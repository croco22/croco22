## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What's at the tip of this interstellar jet?  First let's consider the jet: it is being expelled by a star system just forming and is cataloged as Herbig-Haro 49 (HH 49).  The star system expelling this jet is not visible -- it is off to the lower right.  The complex conical structure featured in this infrared image by the James Webb Space Telescope also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50.  The fast jet particles impact the surrounding interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in infrared light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges.  This JWST image also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at HH 49's tip: it is a spiral galaxy far in the distance.  The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually spiral arms.   Jump Around the Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>In April, we typically experience extreme weather events, and I’m sure we’ve all heard the saying “April showers bring May flowers”. But did you know there are storms across the solar system as well? Lightning, high winds, and even rain, can affect our planetary neighbors.</p>
<p>To dive into the stormy weather of April, we’re going to explore how storms affect different neighbors in the solar system. Throughout different days in the month, we’ll be visiting different solar system neighbors and learning about their extreme weather.</p>

<p>Starting with the largest neighbor in the solar system: the Sun. The Sun is the reason for a phenomena called “space weather”. Sometimes the Sun burps out solar flares and large amounts of radiation called “solar wind” that can affect the Earth. When this solar wind encounters the Earth’s magnetosphere, it can cause beautiful light displays called auroras. These auroras are typically experienced at high-latitudes like the poles, but if the solar wind is powerful enough, the auroras can make their way all the way down to the mid-latitudes where we live!</p>
