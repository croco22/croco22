## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Is the sky the same every night? No -- the night sky changes every night in many ways. To better explore how the night sky changes, the USA's NSF and DOE commissioned the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Cerro Pachón, Chile. In final testing before routine operations, Rubin will begin to explore these nightly changes -- slight differences that can tell us much about our amazing universe and its surprising zoo of objects. With a mirror over 8 meters across, Rubin will continually reimage the entire visible sky every few nights to discover new supernovas, potentially dangerous asteroids, faint comets, and variable stars -- as well as mapping out the visible universe's large-scale structure.  Pictured, the distant central band of our Milky Way Galaxy appears to flow out from the newly operational observatory. Taken last month, the featured picture is a composite of 21 images across the night sky, capturing airglow on the horizon and the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy on the lower left.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>On this date in 1965, astronaut Edward H. White II became the first American to perform a spacewalk. He spent about 20 minutes outside the Gemini IV capsule as he orbited roughly 120 miles above the surface of Earth.</p>

<p>This photo was taken by Command Pilot, James A. McDivitt, as White performed his EVA. The EVA was meant to test maneuverability of tools such as the Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit for future spacewalks.</p>
<p>Gemini IV would unfortunately be White’s only spaceflight as he, and Gemini IV CAPCOM support crew Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee, would perish in the Apollo I fire almost two years later in 1967.</p>
