## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
If you could stand on Venus -- what would you see?  Pictured is the view from Venera 14, a robotic Soviet lander which parachuted and air-braked down through the thick Venusian atmosphere in March of 1982. The desolate landscape it saw included flat rocks, vast empty terrain, and a featureless sky above Phoebe Regio near Venus' equator. On the lower left is the spacecraft's penetrometer used to make scientific measurements, while the light piece on the right is part of an ejected lens-cap.  Enduring temperatures near 450 degrees Celsius and pressures 75 times that on Earth, the hardened Venera spacecraft lasted only about an hour. Although data from Venera 14 was beamed across the inner Solar System over 40 years ago, digital processing and merging of Venera's unusual images continues even today.  Recent analyses of infrared measurements taken by ESA's orbiting Venus Express spacecraft indicate that active volcanoes may currently exist on Venus.    Jigsaw Fun: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun at approximately 30.4 million miles (48.9 million km) which causes the planet to heat up to extreme temperatures. However, because Mercury has little to no atmosphere, it is not able to hold the heat. This means that as day turns to night, temperatures drop drastically. Daytime temperatures on Mercury can reach up to 800°F (430°C), while nighttime temperatures reach as low as -290°F (-180°C).</p>

<p>This image is one of the first up-close images of Mercury. It was taken by the Mariner 10 spacecraft in March of 1974. Mariner 10 was also the first spacecraft sent to Mercury. This shot of Mercury shows us the terminator line, or the line separating day and night on the little planet, where temperatures on either side have a 1,000-degree difference.</p>
