## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This close-up from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera shows weathered craters and windblown deposits in southern Acidalia Planitia. A striking shade of blue in standard HiRISE image colors, to the human eye the area would probably look grey or a little reddish. But human eyes have not gazed across this terrain, unless you count the eyes of NASA astronauts in the sci-fi novel, "The Martian," by Andy Weir. The novel chronicles the adventures of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded at the fictional Mars mission Ares 3 landing site, corresponding to the coordinates of this cropped HiRISE frame. For scale, Watney's 6-meter-diameter habitat at the site would be about 1/10th the diameter of the large crater. Of course, the Ares 3 landing coordinates are only about 800 kilometers north of the (real life) Carl Sagan Memorial Station, the 1997 Pathfinder landing site.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The largest of all 88 modern constellations can be seen in the southwest sky around 10:00pm tonight. Hydra, known as the multi-headed serpent from Greek legend, can be found just below prominent springtime patters, Virgo and Leo.</p>

<p>Spanning from the southern to the western horizon, Hydra is typically symbolizing a large sea serpent swimming through the sky. But there are lots of different interpretations of the snake. For example, the name Hydra typically evokes the story of Hercules slaying the Lernaean Hydra during his second of 12 labors.</p>
