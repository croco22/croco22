## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Sure, that figure-8 shaped curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun in Earth's sky at the same time each day over one year is called an analemma. On the left, Earth's figure-8 analemma was traced by combining wide-angle digital images recorded during the year from December 2011 through December 2012. But the shape of an analemma depends on the eccentricity of a planet's orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation, so analemma curves can look different for different worlds. Take Mars for example. The Red Planet's axial tilt is similar to Earth's, but its orbit around the same sun is more eccentric (less circular) than Earth's orbit. As seen from the Martian surface, the analemma traced in the right hand panel is shaped more like a tear drop. The Mars rover Opportunity captured the images used over the Martian year corresponding to Earth dates July 2006 to June 2008. Of course, each world's solstice dates still lie at the top and bottom of their different analemma curves. The last Mars northern summer solstice was May 29, 2025. Our fair planet's 2025 northern summer solstice is at June 21, 2:42 UTC.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this day in 2005, the first solar sail spacecraft, <i>Cosmos 1</i>, was launched. Intended to be a proof-of-concept of solar sail propulsion, the craft did not reach its intended orbit due to a rocket malfunction. The first successful solar sail craft would be launched in 2010 by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).</p>

<p>Upon a successful placement into orbit, the spacecraft would have deployed a large sail which would have been propelled by solar photons to increase the crafts velocity. As well as potentially becoming the first use of solar sails in an orbital craft, it this mission was successful it would have been the first space mission by a space advocacy group as it was planned and funded by The Planetary Society. The image above is an artist’s interpretation of a successful <i>Cosmos 1</i> with its deployed solar sail in orbit.</p>
