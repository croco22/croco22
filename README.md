## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What is creating the strange texture of IC 418?  Dubbed the Spirograph Nebula for its resemblance to drawings from a cyclical drawing tool, planetary nebula IC 418 shows patterns that are not well understood. Perhaps they are related to chaotic winds from the variable central star, which changes brightness unpredictably in just a few hours.  By contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago, IC 418 was probably a well-understood star similar to our Sun.  Only a few thousand years ago, IC 418 was probably a common red giant star.  Since running out of nuclear fuel, though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a hot remnant core destined to become a white-dwarf star, visible in the image center. The light from the central core excites surrounding atoms in the nebula causing them to glow. IC 418 lies about 2000 light-years away and spans 0.3 light-years across.  This false-color image taken from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals the unusual details.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Today’s forecast calls for large stinky storms on Uranus. Researchers have discovered that the clouds that make up the storms on Uranus are made of the compound hydrogen-sulfide. You know, the gas that smells like rotten eggs? Feels like the punchline to one big cosmic joke!</p>

<p>The image of Uranus was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope during its Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy (OPAL) observing program. Not only do we get a look at the faint ring system around Uranus, but we can see multiple of the smelly storms in question around the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.</p>
