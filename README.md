## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Our Sun frequently erupts in loops.  Hot solar plasma jumps off the Sun's surface into prominences, with the most common type of prominence being a simple loop.  The loop shape originates from the Sun's magnetic field, which is traced by spiraling electrons and protons.  Many loops into the Sun's lower corona are large enough to envelop the Earth and are stable enough to last days.  They commonly occur near active regions that also include dark sunspots.  The featured panel shows four loops, each of which was captured near the Sun's edge during 2024 and 2025. The images were taken by a personal telescope in Mantova, Italy and in a very specific color of light emitted primarily by hydrogen. Some solar prominences suddenly break open and eject particles into the Solar System, setting up a space weather sequence that can affect the skies and wires of Earth.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (9 days offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tomorrow morning, a very thin crescent moon will appear in between the planets Venus and Jupiter. The Moon will only be about 7% illuminated.</p>

<p>Sunrise will begin at 5:55am tomorrow morning. This means your window to see these three close together in the sky is very short. Make sure to head out around 5:00am with a clear view of the east to catch a look at the trio!</p>
