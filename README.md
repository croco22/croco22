## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This interstellar skyscape spans over 4 degrees across crowded starfields toward the constellation Sagittarius and the central Milky Way. A First Look image captured at the new NSF–DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the bright nebulae and star clusters featured include famous stops on telescopic tours of the cosmos: Messier 8 and Messier 20. An expansive star-forming region over a hundred light-years across, Messier 8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. About 4,000 light-years away the Lagoon Nebula harbors a remarkable cluster of young, massive stars. Their intense radiation and stellar winds energize and agitate this cosmic lagoon's turbulent depths. Messier 20's popular moniker is the Trifid. Divided into three parts by dark interstellar dust lanes, the Trifid Nebula's glowing hydrogen gas creates its dominant red color. But contrasting blue hues in the colorful Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight. The Rubin Observatory visited the Trifid-Lagoon field to acquire all the image data during parts of four nights (May 1-4). At full resolution, Rubin's magnificent Sagittarius skyscape is 84,000 pixels wide and 51,500 pixels tall.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>The moon will reach its new moon phase at approximately 5:31am. The nights on and surrounding new moon leave a darker sky than normal ideal for stargazing and telescope observing.</p>

<p>Many globular clusters can be found by looking toward the south around midnight tonight. The globular clusters tend to be found closest to the galactic center. Each crosshair in the image above represents on of many globular clusters in the summer sky.</p>
