## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Planet Earth hangs in the background of this space age selfie. The snapshot was captured by the IM-2 Nova-C lander Athena, just after stage separation following its February 26 launch to the Moon. A tall robotic lander, Athena is scheduled to touch down on Thursday, March 6, in Mons Mouton, a plateau near the Moon’s South Pole. The intended landing site is in the central portion of one of the Artemis 3 potential landing regions. Athena carries rovers and experiments as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, including a drill intended to explore beneath the lunar surface in a search for evidence of frozen water. It also carries a propulsive drone dubbed the Micro Nova Hopper. After release to the lunar surface, the autonomous drone is intended to hop into a nearby crater and send science data back to the lander.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>Tonight, there will be a conjunction of the Moon and Mercury. These two will make a close approach and share the same right ascension. You won’t have long to view the pair though, as they will set below the horizon 1 hour and 17 minutes after the sun around 7:09pm.</p>

<p>The Moon will also be only 1 day old, making it more of a challenge to see this conjunction. A pair of binoculars could help with viewing though, but make sure the sun has fully set before pointing binoculars towards the west.</p>
