## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Most globular star clusters roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy, but globular cluster NGC 6366 lies close to the galactic plane. About 12,000 light-years away toward the constellation Ophiuchus, the cluster's starlight is dimmed and reddened by the Milky Way's interstellar dust when viewed from planet Earth. As a result, the stars of NGC 6366 look almost golden in this telescopic scene, especially when seen next to relatively bright, bluish, and nearby star 47 Ophiuchi. Compared to the hundred thousand stars or so gravitationally bound in distant NGC 6366, 47 Oph itself is a binary star system  a mere 100 light-years away. Still, the co-orbiting stars of 47 Oph are too close together to be individually distinguished in the image.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Did you know the paws of Ursa Major, the Great Bear, also belong to a spring asterism known as the Three Leaps of the Gazelle? The asterism is made up of three pairs of close together stars which appear like the hoof prints of a running Gazelle.</p>

<p>The origin behind this asterism is believed to be of an Arabic legend. It is said that the three pairs represent the leaps of a gazelle as it dashed off across a pond after being startled by the celestial lion, Leo.</p>
