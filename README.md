## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor's Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown by a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula's filamentary structures. The star in the center of Thor's Helmet is expected to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime within the next few thousand years.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (3 days offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>It is possible to see satellites in the night sky. Some, like the International Space Station, can appear even brighter than some stars. In fact, tonight there will be a pass of the international space station from the WSW to the NE, taking almost seven minutes to move across the sky.</p>

<p>The space station will reach an apparent magnitude of -3.0 during this pass, which will put it in between the brightness values of Venus and Jupiter. Venus will be the brightest point of light at -4.1, followed by the ISS, then Jupiter next at a magnitude of -2.1. The larger the negative number, the brighter the object.</p>
