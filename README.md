## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Tidally locked in synchronous rotation, the Moon always presents its familiar nearside to denizens of planet Earth. From lunar orbit, the Moon's farside can become familiar, though. In fact this sharp picture, a mosaic from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's wide angle camera, is centered on the lunar farside. Part of a global mosaic of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011, the highest resolution version shows features at a scale of 100 meters per pixel. Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the farside looks very different from the nearside covered with smooth dark lunar maria.  A likely explanation is that the farside crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form dark, smooth maria.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 1911, the Nakhla meteorite fall occurred. The Nakhla meteorite is a Martian achondrite that fell in in Al Buhayrah, Egypt. It is only one of 5 Martian meteorites to be seen falling to Earth.</p>

<p>A Martian meteorite is a rock that forms on Mars which is then ejected from the planet from an impact event. It then travels through interplanetary space before landing on the Earth as a Meteorite. The image on the left is an electron microscope image of the meteorite showing microscopic pits on the surface. On Earth rocks, similar pits like this are carved by bacteria. The image on the right is a photo of one of the fragments after being broken open.</p>
