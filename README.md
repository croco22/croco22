## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Beautiful island universe Messier 94 lies a mere 15 million light-years distant in the northern constellation of the hunting dogs, Canes Venatici. A popular target for earth-based astronomers, the face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across, with spiral arms sweeping through the outskirts of its broad disk. But this Hubble Space Telescope field of view spans about 7,000 light-years or so across M94's central region. The sharp close-up examines the galaxy's compact, bright nucleus and prominent inner dust lanes, surrounded by a remarkable bluish ring of young, massive stars. The massive stars in the ring appear to be less than about 10 million years old, indicating the galaxy experienced a corresponding well-defined era of rapid star formation. As a result, while the small, bright nucleus is typical of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, M94 is also known as a starburst galaxy. Because M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can explore in detail reasons for the galaxy's burst of star formation.  Today's Coverage: Moon Landing

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>Tonight, the Moon, the Pleiades star cluster and Jupiter will be close together in the sky. The Moon will be one day from its first quarter phase for this cycle. On the eastern side of the Moon, you will find Jupiter and on the western side of the Moon you will find the Pleiades star cluster.</p>

<p>The reason why we find Jupiter and the Moon in Taurus is because the bull is a zodiac constellation. The zodiac represent what’s known as the plane of the ecliptic, or essentially the plane of the solar system. All the large solar system objects, such as the Earth, Moon and other planets, fall along a very particular plane in space. That plane is represented by the 12 zodiac constellations here on Earth.</p>
