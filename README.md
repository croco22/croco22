## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This stunning starfield spans about three full moons (1.5 degrees) across the heroic northern constellation of Perseus. It holds the famous pair of open star clusters, h and Chi Persei. Also cataloged as NGC 869 (right) and NGC 884, both clusters are about 7,000 light-years away and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  Separated by only a few hundred light-years, the clusters are both 13 million years young based on the ages of their individual stars, evidence that both clusters were likely a product of the same star-forming region. Always a rewarding sight in binoculars or small telescopes, the Double Cluster is even visible to the unaided eye from dark locations.

<p>Tomorrow morning, a very thin crescent moon will appear in between the planets Venus and Jupiter. The Moon will only be about 7% illuminated.</p>

<p>Sunrise will begin at 5:55am tomorrow morning. This means your window to see these three close together in the sky is very short. Make sure to head out around 5:00am with a clear view of the east to catch a look at the trio!</p>
