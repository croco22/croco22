## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why does this Moon look so unusual?  A key reason is its vivid red color. The color is caused by the deflection of blue light by Earth's atmosphere -- the same reason that the daytime sky appears blue.  The Moon also appears unusually distorted.  Its strange structuring is an optical effect arising from layers in the Earth's atmosphere that refract light differently due to sudden differences in temperature or pressure.  A third reason the Moon looks so unusual is that there is, by chance, an airplane flying in front. The featured picturesque gibbous Moon was captured about two weeks ago above Turin, Italy. Our familiar hovering sky orb was part of an unusual quadruple alignment that included two historic ground structures: the Sacra di San Michele on the near hill and Basilica of Superga just beyond.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>On this date in 1972, the American probe <em>Pioneer 10</em> launched using a three-stage version of the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle. The probe reached a maximum escape velocity of 32,110 miles per hour. This made it the fastest human-made object in existence, up to that point.</p>

The image on the right is Jupiter taken by the <em>Pioneer 10</em> spacecraft as it flew by in 1973, before performing its slingshot maneuver that would give it enough speed to take it out of the solar system.</p>
