## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
A small, dark, nebula looks isolated near the center of this telescopic close-up. The wedge-shaped cosmic cloudlet lies within a relatively crowded region of space though. About 7,000 light-years distant and filled with glowing gas and an embedded cluster of young stars, the region is known as M16 or the Eagle Nebula. Hubble's iconic images of the Eagle Nebula include the famous star-forming Pillars of Creation, towering structures of interstellar gas and dust 4 to 5 light-years long. But this small dark nebula, known to some as a Bok globule, is a fraction of a light-year across. The Bok globule stands out in silhouette against the expansive background of M16's diffuse glow. Found scattered within emission nebulae and star clusters, Bok globules are small interstellar clouds of cold molecular gas and obscuring dust that also form stars within their dense, collapsing cores.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (11 days offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tomorrow morning, a very thin crescent moon will appear in between the planets Venus and Jupiter. The Moon will only be about 7% illuminated.</p>

<p>Sunrise will begin at 5:55am tomorrow morning. This means your window to see these three close together in the sky is very short. Make sure to head out around 5:00am with a clear view of the east to catch a look at the trio!</p>
