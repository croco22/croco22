## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Transfusing sunlight as the sky grew darker, this exceptional display of noctilucent clouds was captured on July 10, reflected in the calm waters of Vallentuna Lake near Stockholm, Sweden. From the edge of space, about 80 kilometers above Earth's surface, the icy clouds themselves still reflect sunlight, even though the Sun is below the horizon as seen from the ground. Usually spotted at high latitudes in summer months, the night shining clouds have made a strong showing so far during the short northern summer nights. Also known as polar mesopheric clouds they are understood to form as water vapor driven into the cold upper atmosphere condenses on the fine dust particles supplied by disintegrating meteors or volcanic ash.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 1979, NASA’s Skylab space station tumbled back to Earth. Skylab was the first U.S. space station and was originally planned to be used with the Space Shuttle. However, the Space Shuttle was delayed and was not able to re-boost Skylab into a higher orbit. This caused the space station’s orbit to decay and re-enter the atmosphere. As it entered the atmosphere debris was scattered across the Indian Ocean and Australia.</p>
