## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Main belt asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson is about 8 kilometers long and 3.5 kilometers across. On April 20, this sharp close-up of the asteroid was captured at a distance of about 1100 kilometers by the Lucy spacecraft's long range camera during its second asteroid encounter. Named after American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, discoverer of the Lucy hominid fossil, the elongated asteroid was likely formed about 150 million years ago from a gentle collision of two smaller bodies creating its characteristic contact binary shape. Launched in October of 2021, the Lucy spacecraft will continue its travels through the main asteroid belt in 2025, but is on its way to explore Jupiter's swarm of Trojan asteroids. Lucy is expected to encounter its first Trojan asteroid target, 3548 Eurybates, in August 2027.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Forecast calls for a rainy day on Titan! Titan is a special moon due to it being the only other world in the solar system that has bodies of liquid on its surface. Although on Titan its not liquid water, but liquid methane that forms huge rivers and lakes on the surface. Due to this, Titan is the only other place with a liquid cycle like the water cycle here on Earth.</p>

<p>These three images show us different views of Titan’s atmosphere all taken by the Cassini spacecraft. The image on the left is a true color image of Titan, showcasing the thick atmosphere that creates the methane this moon experiences. The atmosphere is so thick that in true color, we cannot see the surface of Titan. The center and right images are both images taken with infrared-sensitive instruments that can peer through the atmosphere. They show us the surface where we can see how the methane rain, and other environmental factors, have potentially altered the landscape. The center image is a monochrome view, and the right image is a false color view.</p>
