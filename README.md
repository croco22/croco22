## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Big beautiful barred spiral galaxy Messier 109 is the 109th entry in Charles Messier's famous catalog of bright Nebulae and Star Clusters. You can find it just below the Big Dipper's bowl in the northern constellation Ursa Major. In fact, bright dipper star Phecda, Gamma Ursa Majoris, produces the glare at the upper right corner of this telescopic frame. M109's prominent central bar gives the galaxy the appearance of the Greek letter "theta", θ, a common mathematical symbol representing an angle. M109 spans a very small angle in planet Earth's sky though, about 7 arcminutes or 0.12 degrees. But that small angle corresponds to an enormous 120,000 light-year diameter at the galaxy's estimated 60 million light-year distance. The brightest member of the now recognized Ursa Major galaxy cluster, M109 (aka NGC 3992) is joined by spiky foreground stars. Three small, fuzzy bluish galaxies also on the scene, identified (top to bottom) as UGC 6969, UGC 6940 and UGC 6923, are possibly satellite galaxies of the larger barred spiral galaxy Messier 109.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this day in 1997, the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker spacecraft imaged the asteroid Mathilde on course to study the asteroid Eros. In 2001, NEAR Shoemaker would make history as the first craft to land on an asteroid.</p>

<p>This image of Mathilde was captured during Near Shoemaker’s flyby. From a distance of 1,212 km, the spacecraft took over 500 images of the asteroid. These images helped astronomers to make more accurate measurements of the asteroid’s dimensions and mass.</p>
