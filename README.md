## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
There's a new lander on the Moon. Yesterday Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost executed the first-ever successful commercial lunar landing. During its planned 60-day mission, Blue Ghost will deploy several NASA-commissioned scientific instruments, including PlanetVac which captures lunar dust after creating a small whirlwind of gas. Blue Ghost will also host the telescope LEXI that captures X-ray images of the Earth's magnetosphere. LEXI data should enable a better understanding of how Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the Sun's wind and flares.  Pictured, the shadow of the Blue Ghost lander is visible on the cratered lunar surface, while the glowing orb of the planet Earth hovers just over the horizon. Goals for future robotic Blue Ghost landers include supporting lunar astronauts in NASA's Artemis program, with Artemis III currently scheduled to land humans back on the Moon in 2027.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>Did you know there is a dwarf planet that resides in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter? It’s called Ceres and it accounts for 25% of the total mass of the Asteroid Belt.</p>
<p>Ceres was discovered in 1801, and was originally announced as a planet. Although, similar to Pluto, after further discoveries it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Ceres is also the only dwarf planet not found beyond Neptune.</p>

<p>This image of the surface of Ceres was taken by the spacecraft <i>Dawn</i> that visited the dwarf planet in 2015, and another asteroid belt object of interest, known as Vesta, in 2012. <i>Dawn</i> has since been retired and now sits in a stable orbit around Ceres.</p>
