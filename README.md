## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
About 1,300 images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft's wide angle camera were used to compose this spectacular view of a familiar face - the lunar nearside. But why is there a lunar nearside? The Moon rotates on its axis and orbits the Earth at the same rate, about once every 28 days. Tidally locked in this configuration, the synchronous rotation always keeps one side, the nearside, facing Earth. As a result, featured in remarkable detail in the full resolution mosaic, the smooth, dark, lunar maria (actually lava-flooded impact basins), and rugged highlands, are well-known to earthbound skygazers. To find your favorite mare or large crater, just follow this link or slide your cursor over the picture. The LRO images used to construct the mosaic were recorded over a two week period in December 2010.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 1969, Apollo 11 achieves the first landing of humans on the moon.  The LM touched down on the moon at 4:18pm EDT. Armstrong reported to mission control at MSC, “Houston, Tranquility Base here – the Eagle has landed.” Later, Man’s first step on the moon was taken by Neil Armstrong at 10:56 p.m. EDT. As he stepped onto the surface of the moon, Armstrong described the feat as “one small step for [a] man – one giant leap for Mankind.”</p>

<p>The photo above is one of the most famous photos taken during the Apollo missions. This boot print, left by Aldrin, was to test the physical properties of the lunar regolith. Due to the Moon’s lack of atmosphere, erosion from wind and water does not occur. All boot prints from the Apollo missions remain on the lunar surface today.</p>
