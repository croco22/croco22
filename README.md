## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
With spacecraft thrusters at top center, the rugged surface of the Moon lies below the Blue Ghost lander in this space age video frame. The view of the lunar far side was captured by the Firefly Aerospace lunar lander on February 24, following a maneuver to circularize its orbit about 100 kilometers above the lunar surface. The robotic lunar lander is scheduled to touch down tomorrow, Sunday, March 2, at 3:34am Eastern Time in the Mare Crisium impact basin on the lunar near side. In support of the Artemis campaign, Blue Ghost is set to deliver science and technology experiments to the Moon, part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Blue Ghost's mission on the surface is planned to operate during the lunar daylight hours at the landing site, about 14 Earth days.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>Tonight, there will be a conjunction of the Moon and Mercury. These two will make a close approach and share the same right ascension. You won’t have long to view the pair though, as they will set below the horizon 1 hour and 17 minutes after the sun around 7:09pm.</p>

<p>The Moon will also be only 1 day old, making it more of a challenge to see this conjunction. A pair of binoculars could help with viewing though, but make sure the sun has fully set before pointing binoculars towards the west.</p>
