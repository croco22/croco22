## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Very faint planetary nebula Abell 7 is about 1,800 light-years distant. It lies just south of Orion in planet Earth's skies toward the constellation Lepus, The Hare. Surrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to distant background galaxies its generally simple spherical shape, about 8 light-years in diameter, is revealed in this deep telescopic image. Within the cosmic cloud are beautiful and complex structures though, enhanced by the use of long exposures and narrowband filters that capture emission from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms. Otherwise Abell 7 would be much too faint to be appreciated by eye. A planetary nebula represents a very brief final phase in stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion years hence, as the nebula's central, once sun-like star shrugs off its outer layers. Abell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old. But its central star, seen here as a fading white dwarf, is some 10 billion years old.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>On this date 1937, Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova was born. At only 26 years old, Tereshkova became the first woman to fly in space. Prior to travelling to space, she worked in a textile mill and trained as a parachutist, which aided in her cosmonaut selection. Following her spaceflight, Tereshkova continued to push for more women in the Soviet space program. Tereshkova remains the only woman of any nationality to complete a solo space flight.</p>

<p>Tereshkova’s historic spaceflight took place on June 16th, 1963, in the Vostok 6 spacecraft. During her mission she orbited the Earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. The image on the left is Tereshkova outside the Vostok 6 capsule; the image on the right is an official stamp of the Soviet Union from 1963 honoring Tereshkova and her mission.</p>
