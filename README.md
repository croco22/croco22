## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
If you have looked at the sky and seen a group of stars about the size of the full Moon, that's the Pleiades (M45). Perhaps the most famous star cluster in the sky, its brightest stars can be seen even from the light-polluted cities. But your unaided eye can also see its nebulosity -- the gas and dust surrounding it -- under dark skies. However, telescopes can catch even more. The bright blue stars of the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, light up their surrounding dust, causing it to appear a diffuse blue that can only be seen under long exposures. But that's not all. The cosmic dust appears to stretch upward like ethereal arms. And the entire structure is surrounded by a reddish glow from the most abundant element in the universe: hydrogen. The featured image is composed of nearly 25 hours of exposure and was captured last year from Starfront Observatory, in Texas, USA  Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>On this date in 1816, Rudolf Wolf was born. Wolf was a Swiss astronomer best known for his discovery of the Sun’s 11-year sunspot cycle. In 1849 he created a system for counting and tracking sunspots known as Wolf numbers, which is still utilized today.</p>

<p>The image to the left is a portrait of Rudolf Wolf taken between 1888 and 1893. The image on the right is the largest sunspot recorded during solar cycle 24, the most recent solar cycle to complete. The cycle lasted from 2008 to 2019, and the spot occurred near solar maximum on October 18th, 2014. This spot was almost 80,00 miles across, which means you could fit 10 Earth’s across its diameter! We are currently in solar cycle 25 and predicted to be in maximum now. During solar maximum there is an uptick in solar activity which leads to more sunspots.</p>
