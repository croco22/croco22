## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This might look like a double-bladed lightsaber, but these two cosmic jets actually beam outward from a newborn star in a galaxy near you. Constructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning scene spans about half a light-year across Herbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400 parsecs away in the stellar nurseries of the Orion B molecular cloud complex. Hidden from direct view, HH 24's central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk. As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up. Opposing jets are blasted out along the system's rotation axis. Cutting through the region's interstellar matter, the narrow, energetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts along their path.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Tonight, Messier 4 is well placed reaching its highest point in the sky around midnight. Found in the summer constellation of Scorpius, this globular cluster, and many others, will continue to be a binocular target throughout the summer.</p>

<p>M4 will be found near the heart of the scorpion, represented by the red star Antares. This cluster is one of the brightest globular clusters in the northern hemisphere with an apparent magnitude around 5.6</p>
