## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Where are Saturn's ears? Galileo is credited, in 1610, as the first person to see Saturn's rings. Testing out Lipperhey's recently co-invented telescope, Galileo did not know what they were and so called them "ears".  The mystery deepened in 1612, when Saturn's ears mysteriously disappeared. Today we know exactly what happened: from the perspective of the Earth, Saturn's rings had become too thin to see.  The same drama plays out every 15 years because Saturn, like Earth, undergoes tilt-driven seasons. This means that as Saturn goes around the Sun, its equator and rings can tilt noticeably toward the Sun and inner Solar System, making them easily visible, but from other orbital locations will appear almost not at all.  The featured picture from Brasilia, Brazil shows a modern version of this sequence: the top ring-dominated image was taken in 2020, while the bottom ring-obscure image taken earlier in 2025.   Make Saturn's Rings Musical: Play them like a harp!

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tomorrow morning there will be a close approach of Venus, Saturn and Neptune low in the early morning sky. When looking toward the eastern horizon around 5:00am, you’ll only see two of the three planets with your eyes alone because Neptune is not a naked eye planet.</p>

<p>When trying to track down Neptune with a telescope this close to sunrise, its always important to remember to never point your telescope at the Sun. Without a specialized solar filter, observing the Sun directly, either with your eyes or a magnifying instrument such as a telescope, can potentially cause vision damage or vision loss. Always observe with caution during twilight or daytime viewing.</p>
