## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This pretty nebula lies some 1,500 light-years away, its shape and color in this telescopic view reminiscent of a robin's egg. The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax). Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn't represent a beginning, though. Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star. In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The blue-green hue inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Looking toward the northwest after sunset tonight, you will find a bright yellowish-orange star low in the sky. This star is called Capella, and it is the 6th brightest star in the sky and the 3rd brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere.</p>

<p>Capella is the brightest star in the winter constellation Auriga the Goatherder. The name Capella translates to “the little goat” or “the little nanny goat” from Latin. Capella will also be near other bright objects and stars on the western horizon such as Jupiter and the red supergiant star Betelgeuse in Orion the Hunter.</p>
