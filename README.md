## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Deimos takes 30 hours and 18 minutes to complete one orbit around the Red Planet. That's a little more than one Martian day or sol which is about 24 hours and 40 minutes long, so Deimos drifts westward across the Martian sky. About 15 kilometers across at its widest, the smallest of Mars' two moons is bright though. In fact Deimos is the brightest celestial object in this Martian skyscape captured before sunrise by Perseverance on March 1, the 1,433rd sol of the Mars rover's mission. The image is a composed of 16 exposures recorded by one of the rover's navigation cameras. The individual exposures were combined into a single image for an enhanced low light view. Regulus and Algeiba, bright stars in the constellation Leo, are also visible in the dark Martian predawn sky.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter at 11 times the size of Earth. The largest planet in the known universe is called ROXs 42 Bb. It is about 1.12 times larger than Jupiter, but it has roughly 9 times the mass.</p>

<p>The image on the left is an artist’s concept of what ROXs 42 Bb could potentially look like. The image on the right is a comparison of the Earth and Jupiter. As well as being the most massive known planet, it also takes a very long time to orbit around its parent star. It sits 157 Astronomical Units away from its star (1AU = 93 million miles). This means it takes this massive planet approximately 1,968 years to complete one orbit.</p>
