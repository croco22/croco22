## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
On April 20, 2023 the shadow of a New Moon raced across planet Earth's southern hemisphere. When viewed along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the Moon in silhouette created a hybrid solar eclipse. Hybrid eclipses are rare and can be seen as a total eclipse or an annular "ring of fire" eclipse depending on the observer's position. Viewers of this much anticipated hybrid event were able to witness a total solar eclipse while anchored in the Indian Ocean near the centerline of the eclipse track off the coast of western Australia. This ship-borne image from renowned eclipse chaser Fred Espenak captured the active Sun's magnificent outer atmosphere, or solar corona, streaming into space. The composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, taken during the 62 seconds of totality, records an extended range of brightness to follow alluring details of the corona not quite visible to the eye.  Fred Espenak (1953-2025)

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Today, Venus is at aphelion. Aphelion is the point in an elliptical orbit where an object is farthest from the Sun. During its 225-day orbit, Venus reaches a maximum of 0.73 AU from the Sun. The orbit of Venus is very-nearly circular and varies only 1.5% between perihelion and aphelion.</p>

<p>Venus will be found low on the eastern horizon in the early morning hours before sunrise. At a magnitude pf -4.3, Venus will be the brightest object on the pre-sunrise sky.</p>
