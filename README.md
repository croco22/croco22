## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Made with a telescope shaded from bright sunlight by an umbrella, on April 5 a well-planned video captured a crescent Venus shining in clear daytime skies from Shoreline, Washington, USA at 11:57AM Pacific Time. It also caught the International Space Station in this single video frame. In close conjunction with the bright planet, the faint outline of the orbital outpost seen at a range of about 400 kilometers appears to be similar in size to the slender planetary crescent. Of course the ISS is much smaller than Venus. Now appearing as planet Earth's brilliant morning star and climbing above the eastern horizon in predawn skies, inner planet Venus was nearly 45 million kilometers from Shoreline.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Calling for a chance of showers on Mercury! Since Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, storms like those found on Earth are not present here. Instead, Mercury has a strange weather pattern known as micro-meteor showers. These tiny dust particles consistently bombard the surface on the dawn-side of Mercury as the planet regularly encounters a population of micrometeoroids orbiting the Sun.</p>

<p>Using MESSENGER’s Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer revealed how these micrometeoroids impact the planets surface throughout a Mercurian day. The presence and concentration of certain elements, such as magnesium and calcium, can help astronomers to understand the shower patterns on the little rocky planet.</p>
