## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why is there a spiral around the North Pole of Mars?  Each winter this pole develops a new outer layer about one meter thick composed of carbon dioxide frozen out of the thin Martian atmosphere.  This fresh layer is deposited on a water-ice layer that exists year round.  Strong winds blow down from above the cap's center and swirl due to the spin of the red planet -- contributing to Planum Boreum's spiral structure.  The featured image is a perspective mosaic generated in 2017 from numerous images taken by ESA's Mars Express and elevations extracted from the laser altimeter aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Today in 1997, NASA’s <i>Sojourner</i> rover was successfully deployed on the surface of Mars. <i>Sojourner</i> was the first wheeled vehicle to operate on an astronomical object other than the Earth or Moon. The rover would successfully explore the surface of Mars for 92 sols, or approximately 95 Earth days.</p>

<p>The name <i>Sojourner</i> was chosen as an honor to Civil War era African-American Abolitionist and women’s rights advocate, Sojourner Truth. The naming of the rover was an essay competition put forth by the Planetary Society in 1994. Participants were to choose a “heroine to whom to dedicate the rover” and write an essay about their accomplishments and how it could be related to the Martian environment. JPL received over 3,500 essays from eight countries, but the winner would be 12-year-old Valerie Ambroise of Bridgeport, CT, and her essay about the accomplishments of Sojourner Truth.</p>
<p>Truth’s birth name was Isabella Bomefree, but she renamed herself to Sojourner Truth after her escape from slavery and into freedom. From there, her life’s mission was to “travel up and down the land” advocating for the right to freedom for all people, living up to her name as Sojourner as the word means “traveler passing through”. Her bravery and wandering nature made her name the perfect fit for the first planetary rover.</p>
