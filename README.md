## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA’s IXPE satellite. X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.   Put it All Together: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Asteroids are rocky remnants left over from the formation of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. To date, the known asteroid count is up to 1,351,400. Most of these are found in orbits between the planets Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<p>When the solar system began forming, the contents of the belt formed as planetesimals, or the smaller precursors of protoplanets. But due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter, it disrupted their ability to coalesce into a new planet due to excess amounts of kinetic energy ripping apart any forming protoplanets. So, that means Jupiter is massive enough to have inhibited the formation of another planet between itself and Mars!</p>
