## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
An interstellar expanse of glowing gas and obscuring dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers from planet Earth, suggesting its popular moniker, the Seagull Nebula. This broadband portrait of the cosmic bird covers a 3.5-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, in the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). The bright head of the Seagull Nebula is cataloged as IC 2177, a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with embedded massive star HD 53367. The larger emission region, encompassing objects with other catalog designations, is Likely part of an extensive shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions. The notable bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris. Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen, this complex of interstellar gas and dust clouds with other stars of the Canis Majoris OB1 association spans over 200 light-years at the Seagull Nebula's estimated 3,800 light-year distance.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 1730 Charles Messier was born. This astronomer catalogued 44 comets and 100 deep sky objects. A deep sky object is a galaxy, star cluster or nebula.  Messier created his catalogue of deep sky objects so astronomers wouldn’t confuse them for comets.</p>

<p>The image above is a painting of Messier painted around 1770 surrounded by some of the Hubble Space Telescopes finest images of objects found within Messier’s catalogue. Messier created this catalogue to help astronomers avoid these objects during their hunt for comets. Ironically, today these objects are some of the most sought after in the sky for amateur astronomers.</p>
