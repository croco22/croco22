## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
On May 7, the Sun setting behind a church bell tower was captured in this filtered and manipulated digital skyscape from Ragusa, Sicily, planet Earth. In this version of the image the colors look bizarre. Still, an intriguing optical illusion known as an afterimage can help you experience the same scene with a more natural looking appearance. To try it, find the sunspots of active region AR4079 grouped near the bottom of the blue solar disk. Relax and stare at the dark sunspot group for about 30 seconds, then close your eyes or shift your gaze to a plain white surface. In a moment an afterimage of the sunset should faintly appear. But the afterimage sunset will have this image's complementary colors and a more normal yellow Sun against a familiar blue sky.

<p>Venus will appear as the brightest object in the eastern sky just before sunrise. After today, Venus will begin its trek back toward the Sun in our sky, heading back to its “evening star” position. It will be a while before its visible in the evening sky though. The next greatest eastern elongation, or Venus’ greatest separation from the Sun in the evening sky, will be on August 15th, 2026.</p>
