## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
It's raining stars.  What appears to be a giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be a tidal stream of stars stripped from a small satellite galaxy. The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy's bright disk. A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651. The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years. The featured deep image was captured in long exposures from Saudi Arabia. The Umbrella Galaxy lies about 50 million light-years distant toward the well-groomed northern constellation of Berenice's Hair (Coma Berenices).   APOD in a Modern Format StellarSnap

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this day in 1973, one of the longest total solar eclipses in recorded history was visible in the Agadez area of northwest Niger. The totality of this eclipse lasted over 7 minutes and 3 seconds. A longer total solar eclipse will not be visible on Earth until 2150.</p>
