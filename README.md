## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Helene, small, icy moon of Saturn. Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point. A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione. In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione's leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione's trailing Lagrange point. The sharp stereo anaglyph was constructed from two Cassini images captured during a close flyby in 2011. It shows part of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Helene mottled with craters and gully-like features.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The summer asterism known as the Summer Triangle will be visible in the eastern sky starting around 4:00am. It will begin climbing higher in the sky until the Sun starts to rise around 6:00am.</p>

<p>In order of descending brightness, the stars of the triangle are named Vega, Altair, and Deneb. These stars are the three brightest stars of the summer sky. This makes them stand out in their asterism against the other stars in the sky.</p>
