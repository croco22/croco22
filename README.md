## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
From our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy, we see NGC 3344 face-on. Nearly 40,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located just 20 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo Minor. This multi-color Hubble Space Telescope close-up of NGC 3344 includes remarkable details from near infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. The frame extends some 15,000 light-years across the spiral's central regions. From the core outward, the galaxy's colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented spiral arms. Of course, the bright stars with a spiky appearance are in front of NGC 3344 and lie well within our own Milky Way.   APOD Turns 30!: Free Public Lecture in Anchorage on Wednesday, June 11 at 7 pm

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, a waxing gibbous moon can be found almost halfway between two stars of different colors. On the right (western) side of the Moon will be the blue star Spica, and on the left (eastern) side of the Moon with be the red star Antares.</p>

<p>The color of a star tells us the temperature of the star. The cooler a star is, the redder it will appear. The hotter a star is the bluer it will appear, even though we tend to associate red with heat and blue with cold. So, this means Spica is much hotter than Antares. If it’s still a little puzzling, think of a campfire that you might roast some smores over this summer. The outer edge of the fire, where it is cooler, glows red. The core of the fire at the center, where it’s the hottest, glows blue. Stars behave the same way!</p>
