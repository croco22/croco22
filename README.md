## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This shadowy landscape of majestic mountains and icy plains stretches toward the horizon on a small, distant world. It was captured from a range of about 18,000 kilometers when New Horizons looked back toward Pluto, 15 minutes after the spacecraft's closest approach on July 14, 2015. The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto's tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view. With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet). That's comparable in height to the majestic mountains of planet Earth. The Plutonian landscape is 380 kilometers (230 miles) across.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, Messier 5 is well placed, reaching its highest point in the sky around midnight. Found in the summer constellation of Serpens, this globular cluster will continue to be a binocular target through the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Under optimum conditions, M5 can be observed naked eye as a very faint fuzzy star. This is due to its apparent magnitude being around 5.6. The limiting magnitude of what the human eye can detect caps around 6.5. Always remember when looking at apparent magnitudes of stars and other deep sky objects, the higher the positive number, the dimmer the object!</p>
