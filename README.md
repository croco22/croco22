## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What does our Milky Way Galaxy look like from the top? Because we are on the inside, humanity can’t get an actual picture. Recently, however, just such a map has been made using location data for over a billion stars from ESA’s Gaia mission. The resulting featured illustration shows that just like many other spiral galaxies, our Milky Way has distinct spiral arms.  Our Sun and most of the bright stars we see at night are in just one arm: Orion. Gaia data bolsters previous indications that our Milky Way has more than two spiral arms. Our Galaxy's center sports a prominent bar.  The colors of our Galaxy's thin disk derive mostly from dark dust, bright blue stars, and red emission nebula. Although data analysis is ongoing, Gaia was deactivated in March after a succession mission.   Jigsaw Challenge: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Full moon occurs today at 11:56am. The full moon of May is often named the Flower Moon, due to the abundance of flowers in bloom during this time of the year!</p>

<p>During a full moon, the entire near side of the lunar disk is illuminated from our perspective. This happens due to the moon being on the opposite side of the Earth than the Sun is. This also means that full moons rise as the Sun sets due to this opposition. So, look toward the eastern horizon around sunset to see the Flower Moon.</p>
