## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
On March 14 the Full Moon slid through Earth's dark umbral shadow and denizens of planet Earth were treated to a total lunar eclipse. Of course, from the Moon's near side that same astronomical syzygy was seen as a solar eclipse. Operating in the Mare Crisium on the lunar surface, the Blue Ghost lander captured this video frame of Earth in silhouette around 3:30am CDT, just as the Sun was emerging from behind the terrestrial disk. From Blue Ghost's lunar perspective the beautiful diamond ring effect, familiar to earthbound solar eclipse watchers, is striking. Since Earth appears about four times the apparent size of the Sun from the lunar surface the inner solar corona, the atmosphere of the Sun most easily seen from Earth during a total solar eclipse, is hidden from view. Still, scattering in Earth's dense atmosphere creates the glowing band of sunlight embracing our fair planet.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (2 days offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the Moon will be at both its aphelion and apogee points of its orbit. This means that the Moon will be at its farther distance from the Earth and the Sun for this current lunar cycle.</p>

<p>Aphelion is in reference to the distance from the Sun, as -helion stems from the Greek word “helios”, which is the ancient Greek personification of the Sun. Apogee is in reference to the distance from the Earth, as –gee or –ge stems from the Greek word “Gaia”, which is the ancient Greek personification of the Earth. This difference in orbit it typically not enough to distinguish in our eyes here on Earth.</p>
