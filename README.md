## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This surprising sky has almost everything.  First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.  More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in Earth's atmosphere is a bright meteor. The dim band of light across the central diagonal is zodiacal light: sunlight reflected from dust in the inner Solar System. The green glow on the far right is aurora high in Earth's atmosphere.  The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom is just a light that was held by the scene-planning astrophotographer. This "almost everything" sky was captured over rocks on Castle Hill, New Zealand late last month.  The featured finished frame is a combination of 10 exposures all taken with the same camera and from the same location.  But what about the astrophotographer himself?  He's pictured too -- can you find him?   Jigsaw Fun: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The Lyrid meteor shower is active every year from April 16 to April 25. The meteor shower’s peak activity occurs tonight which will start around 10:00pm when the shower’s radiant constellation, Lyra the Harp, rises in the northeast.</p>

<p>Lyra the Harp will be at its zenith in the sky around 5:00am, just before the sun rises. At this point in the shower the meteors will be concentrated to high overhead. Lyra the Harp is relatively easy to track down as the brightest star in the constellation, Vega, also belongs to the summer asterism known as the Summer Triangle. The image above shows the position of the summer triangle in the east around 2:00am tomorrow morning.</p>
