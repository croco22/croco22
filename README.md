## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Sometimes, the Moon visits the Pleiades. Technically, this means that the orbit of our Moon takes it directly in front of the famous Pleiades star cluster, which is far in the distance.  The technical term for the event is an occultation, and the Moon is famous for its rare occultations of all planets and several well-known bright stars. The Moon's tilted and precessing orbit makes its occultations of the Seven Sisters star cluster bunchy, with the current epoch starting in 2023 continuing monthly until 2029. After that, though, the next occultation won't occur until 2042.  Taken from Cantabria, Spain on April 1, the featured image is a composite where previous exposures of the Pleiades from the same camera and location were digitally added to the last image to bring up the star cluster's iconic blue glow.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, a waxing gibbous moon will be in the zodiacal constellation of Leo the Lion. The Moon will be right next to the asterism known as the Sickle. This asterism is recognizable due to the backwards shape question mark that is meant to represent the head and mane of the lion.</p>

<p>Leo is one of the most prominent springtime constellations. Along with that, Leo is a zodiac constellation. So, every once in a while, solar system objects will pass in front of the stars that make up the lion.</p>
