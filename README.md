## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why does this galaxy look like a curly vegetable?  The Fiddlehead spiral galaxy likely gets its distorted spiral appearance from a gravitational interaction with its close-by elliptical companion NGC 770, seen just below.  Cataloged as NGC 772 and Arp 78, the Fiddlehead spans over 200,000 light years, is a nearby 100 million light years beyond the stars of our Milky Way galaxy, and is visible toward the constellation of the Ram (Aries).  But in the featured image, the Fiddlehead appears to have another companion -- one with a long and fuzzy tail: Comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington.  Though the comet appears to be aimed straight at the massive galaxy, it is actually much closer to us, residing only light minutes away -- well within our Solar System.  The comet will never reach the distant spiral galaxy, nor is it physically related to it.  By a fortunate trick of perspective, though, these two cosmic wonders briefly share the same frame taken late last year from Calern, France.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>On this date in 1960, NASA launched the <i>Pioneer V </i>spacecraft on its journey to explore the space between Earth and Venus. The last scientific measurements were transmitted back to Earth on June 26, 1960. Although the probe only transmitted sporadically for three and a half months, at almost 22.5 million miles in space, <em>Pioneer V</em> was by far the most successful space probe yet launched.</p>

<p>One of the main achievements of <i>Pioneer V </i>was confirming the existence of interplanetary magnetic fields. This image shows the <i>Pioneer V </i>probe with test equipment before launch sometime between 1959 and 1960.</p>
