## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What is going on with this galaxy? NGC 2685 is a confirmed polar ring galaxy - a rare type of galaxy with stars, gas and dust orbiting in rings perpendicular to the plane of a flat galactic disk. The bizarre configuration could be caused by the chance capture of material from another galaxy by a disk galaxy, with the captured debris strung out in a rotating ring. Still, observed properties of NGC 2685 suggest that the rotating helix structure is remarkably old and stable. In this sharp view of the peculiar system also known as Arp 336 or the Helix galaxy, the strange, perpendicular rings are easy to trace as they pass in front of the galactic disk, along with other disturbed outer structures. NGC 2685 is about 50,000 light-years across and 40 million light-years away in the constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major).   Piece it All Together: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 2005, the Cassini spacecraft conducted a flyby of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. The surface of Enceladus is covered in a layer of ice approximately 13 miles (20 km) deep. Beneath the ice is a liquid water ocean that spans the entire moon and is about 25 miles (40 km) deep. The deepest part of Earth’s oceans is called Challenger Deep, which is in the western Pacific Ocean, and is 6.8 miles (10.9 km) deep – much shallower than Enceladus’ global ocean.</p>

<p>This image of Enceladus was taken during Cassini’s flyby in 2005. This is a false-color image, meaning some of the color has been enhanced. For example, the blue lines are long fracture lines on the icy surface of the moon.</p>
