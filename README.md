## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Cataloged as M1, the Crab Nebula is the first on Charles Messier's famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab's dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023. This cosmic crustacean lies about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Asteroids are rocky remnants left over from the formation of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. To date, the known asteroid count is up to 1,351,400. Most of these are found in orbits between the planets Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<p>When the solar system began forming, the contents of the belt formed as planetesimals, or the smaller precursors of protoplanets. But due to the gravitational influence of Jupiter, it disrupted their ability to coalesce into a new planet due to excess amounts of kinetic energy ripping apart any forming protoplanets. So, that means Jupiter is massive enough to have inhibited the formation of another planet between itself and Mars!</p>
