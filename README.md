## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Many spiral galaxies have bars across their centers.  Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar. Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, featured here, was captured in spectacular detail in an image taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Visible are dark filamentary dust lanes, young clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of stars across the center, and a bright active nucleus that likely houses a supermassive black hole.  Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 1672, which spans about 75,000 light years across. NGC 1672, which appears toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish (Dorado), has been studied to find out how a spiral bar contributes to star formation in a galaxy's central regions.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>On this date in 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) arrived at Mars, successfully completing its orbit insertion. The MRO is still in operation, and continues to send back data on the planet’s atmosphere, surface, and subsurface. The focus of this mission is to better understand the history of water on the Red Planet. Scientists have recently used MRO data to propose that water existed on Mars as recently as 2 billion years ago – rather than 3 billion years ago, as has been previously believed.</p>

<p>These three images represent views of Mars taken by the MRO. The left image is of Mars’ moon Phobos from around 4,200 miles away. Next, the middle image shows tectonic fractures found within the Candor Chasma region of Valles Marineris. A canyon on Mars that showcases erosion processes on the surface. Finally, the right image is of Victoria crater, an impact crater that was visited by the <em>Opportunity</em> rover, which took over 21 months for the rover to reach. In fact, at the “ten o’clock” position, <em>Opportunity</em> can be seen as a teeny dot at the edge of the crater. All three photos were taken by the MRO’s HiRISE camera.</p>
