## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.  At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.  In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.   Piece it All Together: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Tonight, the Great Hercules Globular Cluster is well placed, reaching its highest point in the sky around midnight. Found in the summer constellation of Hercules, this globular cluster will continue to be a binocular target through the coming weeks.</p>

<p>M13 is found between the two western most stars of an asterism known as “The Keystone”. This is meant to be the trapezoid shaped torso of Hercules. The globular cluster is one of the brightest clusters in the northern hemisphere and regarded as one of the most magnificent to track down.</p>
