## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
How do stars form? Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, later NEOWISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.  A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.  The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.  In the featured scientifically colored infrared image, spectacular pillars left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas provide further visual clues. W5 is also known as Westerhout 5 (W5) and IC 1848.  Together with IC 1805, the nebulas form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas. The featured image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars.  W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this Day in 1937, geologist and paleoclimatologist Nicholas Shackleton was born. Shackleton’s research helped to identify carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas and that excessive emissions into the atmosphere can contribute to global climate change.</p>

<p>The knowledge of carbon dioxides effect on the atmosphere has not only expanded our knowledge of how our climate is changing from its effects, but also how other planets could be affected by carbon dioxide as well. For example, Venus’ atmosphere is composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide and has what’s known as a runaway greenhouse effect. This causes the planet to hold on to heat from the Sun too effectively, resulting in surface temperatures of approximately 900 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
