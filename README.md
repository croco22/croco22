## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This was once a beach -- on ancient Mars. The featured 360-degree panorama, horizontally compressed, was taken in 2017 by the robotic Curiosity rover that explored the red planet. Named Ogunquit Beach after its terrestrial counterpart, evidence shows that at times long ago the area was underwater, while at other times it was at the edge of an ancient lake.  The light peak in the central background is the top of Mount Sharp, the central feature in Gale Crater where Curiosity explored. Portions of the dark sands in the foreground were  scooped up for analysis.  The light colored bedrock is composed of sediment that likely settled at the bottom of the now-dried lakebed.  The featured panorama (interactive version here) was created from over 100 images and seemingly signed by the rover on the lower left.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Today, Venus at inferior solar conjunction. This means that Venus will pass very close to the Sun from our perspective as its orbit will bring it between the Sun and the Earth. This also marks the end of Venus’s evening apparition as it moves back into the morning sky.</p>

<p>During this time, Venus is also passing through its perigee point. This is when Venus is closest to Earth in its orbit. The second planet will reappear out of the suns glare in the morning sky in a few weeks.</p>
