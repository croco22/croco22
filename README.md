## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What's happened in Hebes Chasma on Mars? Hebes Chasma is a depression just north of the enormous Valles Marineris canyon.  Since the depression is unconnected to other surface features, it is unclear where the internal material went. Inside Hebes Chasma is Hebes Mensa, a 5 kilometer high mesa that appears to have undergone an unusual partial collapse -- a collapse that might be providing clues. The featured image, taken by ESA's robotic Mars Express spacecraft currently orbiting Mars, shows great details of the chasm and the unusual horseshoe shaped indentation in the central mesa. Material from the mesa appears to have flowed onto the floor of the chasm, while a possible dark layer appears to have pooled like ink on a downslope landing.  One hypothesis holds that salty rock composes some lower layers in Hebes Chasma, with the salt dissolving in melted ice flows that drained through holes into an underground aquifer.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>In 1975 on this date, the Soviet Union launched Soyuz 19, their part of the joint US-Soviet flight known as the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, a flight meant to show the thawing political tensions between the two nations. On July 17, the two spacecraft docked and for the next two days the crew members rotated between the two spacecraft, conducting various mainly ceremonial activities.</p>

<p>This image was taken by the American crew in the Apollo Command Module (ACM) of the Soyuz capsule prior to docking the two spacecraft together. The docking mechanism of the ACM can be seen at the top of the image above the Soyuz capsule.</p>
