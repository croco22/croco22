## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why does Jupiter have rings?  Jupiter's main ring was discovered in 1979 by NASA's passing Voyager 1 spacecraft, but its origin was then a mystery.  Data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, however, confirmed the hypothesis that this ring was created by meteoroid impacts on small nearby moons.  As a small meteoroid strikes tiny Metis, for example, it will bore into the moon, vaporize, and explode dirt and dust off into a Jovian orbit. The featured image of Jupiter in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope shows not only Jupiter and its clouds, but this ring as well. Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) -- in comparatively light color on the right, Jupiter's large moon Europa -- in the center of diffraction spikes on the left, and Europa's shadow -- next to the GRS -- are also visible. Several features in the image are not yet well understood, including the seemingly separated cloud layer on Jupiter's right limb.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>On this day in 1899, American engineer James S. McDonnell was born. McDonnell was the president of the St. Louis based McDonnell Aircraft Corporation from 1939 to 1972. In addition to being one of the primary aircraft providers for the U.S. Military, McDonnell Aircraft was contracted to build the Mercury and Gemini space capsules.</p>

<p>During the construction of the Saint Louis Planetarium from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, McDonnell donated $200,000 for necessary equipment, such as the planetariums first star projector. The building would then be named after him in 1964. So, every time you visit the Saint Louis Science Center and go to a planetarium show, you’re visiting the James S. McDonnell Planetarium!</p>
