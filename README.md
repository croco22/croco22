## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why is the Moon so dusty? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. On the Moon, eons of constant micrometeorite bombardment have blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.  For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. On the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover's fenders in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear. This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered rover along with the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of "duct tape".

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>As we near the end of the month, Jupiter and Mars will be moving into the western sky around 9:00pm, as we slowly start to lose them to the coming summer skies.</p>

<p>Jupiter will be lower in the west and brighter than Mars. Mars will be higher in the sky, almost directly overhead, and distinguishable from Jupiter due to its red color. Both planets will not be twinkling whereas the stars in the sky twinkle, or scintillate.</p>
