## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
The plane of our Milky Way galaxy extends beyond the limb of planet Earth in this space age exposure captured by astronaut Don Pettit. His camera, with low light and long duration settings, was pointed out the window of a Dragon crew spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on January 29. The orbital outpost was at an altitude of about 400 kilometers above the Pacific Ocean at the time. Motion blurs the Earth below, while the gorgeous view from low Earth orbit includes the Milky Way's prominent satellite galaxies, known as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, near the upper left in the frame. Fans of southern skies can also spot the Southern Cross. The four brightest stars of the famous southern constellation Crux are near picture center, just beyond the edge of the bright horizon and shining through Earth's orange tinted atmospheric glow.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>Tonight, Mercury is at dichotomy and its greatest eastern elongation. Dichotomy refers to the planet’s half phase, as the inner planets exhibit phases like our Moon. The greatest eastern elongation refers to Mercury being at its farthest distance from the eastern side of the Sun in the sky.</p>

<p>Venus will be a good guide for tracking down Mercury, as its quite bright and stands out as that “evening star”. Once you find Venus, just slightly below it and to the left will be Mercury.</p>
