## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
The most massive young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud is NGC 346, embedded in our small satellite galaxy's largest star forming region some 210,000 light-years distant. Of course the massive stars of NGC 346 are short lived, but very energetic.  Their winds and radiation sculpt the edges of the region's dusty molecular cloud triggering star-formation within. The star forming region also appears to contain a large population of infant stars. A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet burning hydrogen in their cores, the infant stars are strewn about the embedded star cluster. This spectacular infrared view of NGC 346 is from the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRcam. Emission from atomic hydrogen ionized by the massive stars' energetic radiation as well as molecular hydrogen and dust in the star-forming molecular cloud is detailed in pink and orange hues. Webb's sharp image of the young star-forming region spans 240 light-years at the distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The spring asterism known as the Spring Diamond will be highest in the sky around 11:00pm. Made up by the stars Arcturus, Spica, Denebola, and Cor Caroli, this asterism houses some of the most prominent springtime constellations such as Boötes, Virgo, and Leo.</p>

<p>Sometimes this asterism can also be known as the spring triangle, if you leave out Cor Caroli in Canes Venatici. The spring triangle might be easier for beginner sky learners, as Cor Caroli is the faintest star of the diamond and belongs to a very small constellation.</p>
