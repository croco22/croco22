## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
dmonton, Alberta, Canada, planet Earth lies on the horizon. in this stack of panoramic composite images. In a monthly time series arranged vertically top to bottom the ambitious photographic project follows the annual north-south swing of sunrise points, from June solstice to December solstice and back again. It also follows the corresponding, but definitely harder to track, Full Moon rise. Of course, the north-south swing of moonrise runs opposite sunrise along the horizon. But these rising Full Moons also span a wider range on the horizon than the sunrises. That's because the well-planned project (as shown in this video) covers the period June 2024 to June 2025, centered on a major lunar standstill. Major lunar standstills represent extremes in the north-south range of moonrise driven by the 18.6 year precession period of the lunar orbit.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>The summer solstice occurs today marking the beginning of astronomical summer for the northern hemisphere. Due to Earth’s axial tilt, the northern hemisphere is inclined towards the Sun increasing the amount of direct sunlight we are exposed to.</p>

<p>Even though we receive our hottest days in the summer, the Earth reaches its farthest distance from the Sun in the summer. This occurs on July 4th, and it is known as the aphelion. The reason why we don’t feel a difference is for a few reasons. The slight change in distance is not great enough to warrant a change in solar input. Along with this, the Earth’s tilt has a much greater influence on the received amount of solar input than the difference between aphelion and perihelion (Earth’s closest approach to the Sun).</p>
