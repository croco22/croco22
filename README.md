## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Can you identify this celestial object?  Likely not — because this is a discovery image.  Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions. These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.  To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.  The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 — named Scylla by its discoverers—glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.  Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.  Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate. In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) — a nod to the ancient Greek expression "caught between Scylla and Charybdis" from Homer’s Odyssey.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>On this date in 1975, the Soviet spacecraft Venera 9 launched. Venera 9 consisted of both an orbiter and lander, which were the first to orbit Venus and the first to send back images from the surface of another planet, respectively. The images sent back from the surface of Venus were meant to be a 360° panorama; however, one of the lens caps did not release, so only a 180° image was captured.</p>

<p>The image above is the first view of the surface of Venus when Venera landed in October of 1975. Other than photos, atmospheric measurements were taken at the surface as well. The air pressure at the surface was around 9,100 kilopascals, or the equivalent of 90 Earth atmospheres. The air temperature was a staggering 905 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
