## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What do you see when you look into this sky? In the center, in the dark, do you see a night sky filled with stars? Do you see a sunset to the left? Clouds all around? Do you see the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy running down the middle? Do you see the ruins of an abandoned outpost on a hill? (The outpost is on Askold Island, Russia.)  Do you see a photographer with a headlamp contemplating surreal surroundings? (The featured image is a panorama of 38 images taken last month and compiled into a Little Planet projection.)  Do you see a rugged path lined with steps? Or do you see the eye of a dragon?

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 2004, Cassini-Huygens became the first spacecraft to reach and orbit the planet Saturn. Approximately 6 months after reaching Saturn, the Huygens portion of the spacecraft was released and landed on Saturn’s moon Titan. Cassini continued to monitor Saturn and the surrounding system of rings and moons until 2017, when it plunged into Saturn’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>The image above is one of Cassini’s first images taken of Saturn in 2001. When this photo was taken, Cassini was still 177 million miles away from Saturn. Towards the top of the planet, Saturn’s largest moon Titan is visible.
