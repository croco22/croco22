## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place.  Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  Long exposure, multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark dust.  This digital composite features not only three colors of visible light but four colors of infrared light taken by NASA's orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope as well.  The power behind much of the Orion Nebula (M42) is the Trapezium - four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  Many of the filamentary structures visible are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas.  The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Today’s forecast calls for the mother of all jet streams on Saturn! Saturn has a very interesting hexagonal-shaped jet stream at its north pole. This six-sided jet stream is made of 200mph winds and has a massive hurricane like vortex at the center!</p>

<p>These two images of the unique jet stream was taken by NASA’s <i>Cassini</i> spacecraft. The image on the left is a still from a movie created by Cassini of the hexagonal storm in motion. This movie was also the first time that color filters were used to photograph the storm and see the different features that can be harder to see in true color. The image on the right was one of the first full images taken by the spacecraft. <i>Cassini</i> arrived at Saturn when the northern hemisphere was in winter, meaning the storm was shrouded in shadows until spring arrived 5 years after Cassini’s arrival 2004.</p>
