## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
If the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see? The answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video taken during the total lunar eclipse last week from Uruguay. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, causing the Moon to fade dramatically. The Moon never gets completely dark, though, since the Earth's atmosphere refracts some light. As the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon. As the Moon becomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become visible. Most spectacularly, the sky surrounding the eclipsed moon suddenly appears to be full of stars and highlighted by the busy plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. Nearly two hours after the eclipse started, the Moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full glare again dominated the sky.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Today, Saturn’s rings will appear edge on from our perspective here on Earth, making them appear to disappear. This event is known as the ring plane crossing, as Earth is passing through the ring plane from one side to the other.</p>

<p>In July of 2007, the Cassini spacecraft captured this image of Saturn from an edge-on view of the rings. A much more up-close view of what we would see here on Earth. Unfortunately for us, Saturn is currently too close to the Sun from our perspective, and will be lost in the daytime glare. We’ll have to wait another 13-15 years to see the next plane crossing!</p>
