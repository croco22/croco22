## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
How different does sunset appear from Mars than from Earth? For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA's robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Uranus is the 3rd largest planet in our solar system with a diameter of 31,518 miles. It takes Uranus 30,687 Earth days to orbit the Sun. Since its discovery Uranus has only completed 2 full orbits. It will complete its next orbit in 2033.</p>

<p>Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The image above is one of the most recent images taken of Uranus. Captured by the James Webb Space Telescope in 2023, this near-infrared image, with Uranus’ seasonal north pole cap and rings shining brightest, is considered one of the most exquisite photos of the distant planet. Along with the ice giant, many distant galaxies can be seen in the background.</p>
