## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
In digital brush strokes, Jupiter's signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to form this interplanetary post-impressionist work of art. The creative image from citizen scientist Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft's JunoCam. To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing and an oil-painting software filter applied. The image data was captured during perijove 10. That was Juno's December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system's ruling gas giant. At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above northern Jovian cloud tops. Now in an extended mission, Juno has explored Jupiter and its moons since entering orbit around Jupiter in July of 2016.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Forecast calls for infamous storms lasting multiple centuries on Jupiter! One of the most well-known storms in the solar system, the Great Red Spot, has been churning for over a hundred years. The larger-than-the-Earth storm has been shrinking over the past century, and scientists are unsure why.</p>
<p>The great storm was first, officially, observed in September of 1831. There are other accounts of storms seen on Jupiter dating back to 1665, but there is not enough information in the accounts to link those observations with the famous Great Red Spot. But it is possible though that observers since 1665 to today have been observing this particular cyclonic storm.</p>

<p>The image on the left is the first depiction of a large spot seen on the surface of Jupiter, painted by the Italian painter Donato Creti in 1711. The image on the right is a comparison in size of the Great Red Spot and of the Earth.</p>
