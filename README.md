## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Are these trees growing on Mars? No.  Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost. The featured image was taken in 2008 April near the North Pole of Mars. At that time, dark sand on the interior of Martian sand dunes became more and more visible as the spring Sun melted the lighter carbon dioxide ice.  When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks -- streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions but cast no shadows. Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on this image spanning about one kilometer. Close ups of some parts of this image show billowing plumes indicating that the sand slides were occurring even while the image was being taken.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this day in 1995, the NASA Space Shuttle <i>Atlantis</i> docked with the Russian space station <i>Mir</i>. This was the first time a United States shuttle had docked with the Russian space station, marking a pivotal moment of international cooperation in space. <i>Atlantis</i> utilized a special docking module similar to what would be used to dock with the International Space Station.</p>

<p>The image above was taken from the departing Soyuz spacecraft, <i>Uragan</i>, as it was leaving <i>Mir</i>. The combination of <i>Mir</i> and <i>Atlantis</i> docked together made it the largest spacecraft in orbit at the time.</p>
