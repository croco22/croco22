## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
How much mass do flocculent spirals hide?  The featured image of flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to help answer this question. Flocculent spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and NGC 4414 is one of the closest.  Stars and gas near the visible edge of spiral galaxies orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen dark matter must be present to hold them together.  Understanding the matter and dark matter distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, flocculent spirals in general.  Further, calibrating the distance to NGC 4414 helps  humanity calibrate the cosmological distance scale of the entire  visible universe.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Did you know, NASA spends just as much time and effort studying our Earth as it does studying the solar system and beyond? By looking at our Earth from above using satellites, we can get a good look at the “vital signs” of our home, such as air quality, sea levels, and phytoplankton concentrations.</p>

<p>The five images above are datasets showing us information about the Earth’s “vital signs”. Each dataset gives us information gathered from satellites and made into a graphic that can be easily understood. So, each dataset is telling us something different about the Earth. The following datasets are:</p>
<p>These are just of few examples of the datasets provided by NASA satellites.
