## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
If you watch long enough, a comet will appear.  Before then, you will see our Solar System from inside the orbit of Mercury as recorded by NASA's Parker Solar Probe looping around the Sun. The video captures coronal streamers into the solar wind, a small Coronal Mass Ejection, and planets including, in order of appearance, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Between the emergence of Earth and Mars, Comet Tempel 1 appears with a distinctive tail.  The continuous fleeting streaks are high energy particles from the Sun impacting Parker's sideways looking camera.  The featured time-lapse video was taken last year during Encounter 21, Parker's 21st close approach to the Sun.  Studying data and images from Parker are delivering a better understanding of the dynamic Sun's effects on Earth's space weather as well as humanity's power grids, spacecraft, and space-faring astronauts.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Did you know there is a class of exoplanets known as Hot Jupiters? These exoplanets are gas giants similar to Jupiter in our solar system, but they have very short orbital periods around their stars (P &lt; 10 days). This would make them much hotter than our Jupiter due to their proximity to their stars.</p>

<p>This illustration is an artist’s interpretation of a Hot Jupiter orbiting close to its star.</p>
<p>When these exoplanets pass in front of their parent stars, we can use highly sensitive telescopes, such as ESO’s Very Large Telescope, to view the starlight passing through the planet’s atmosphere. From this we can learn what chemical elements make up the planet by looking at how the starlight is filtered through the molecules.</p>
