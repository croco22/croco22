## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Could Queen Calafia's mythical island exist in space? Perhaps not, but by chance the outline of this molecular space cloud echoes the outline of the state of California, USA. Our Sun has its home within the Milky Way's Orion Arm, only about 1,000 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. On the featured image, the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons, stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight. The star most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot, bluish Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula.  A regular target for astrophotographers, the California Nebula can be spotted with a wide-field telescope under a dark sky toward the constellation of Perseus, not far from the Pleiades.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>We hope you set your clocks forward last night! Daylight savings time began this morning around 2:00am. When DST begins, that is when we “spring forward” from standard time and “lose” an hour. We do this so that the Sun will set later in the summer months.</p>

<p>These three posters, and others like them, were issued as a part of a campaign to promote the Standard Time Act of 1918. The posters were also used as a way of persuading the public that Daylight Savings could help the ongoing war effort, as this act was passed at the tail end of World War I.</p>
