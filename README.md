## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why are there so many cyclones around the north pole of Jupiter? The topic is still being researched.  NASA's robotic Juno mission orbiting Jupiter took data in 2018 that was used to construct this stunning view of the curious cyclones at Jupiter's north pole. Measuring the thermal emission from Jovian cloud tops, the infrared observations are not restricted to the hemisphere illuminated by sunlight. They reveal eight cyclonic features that surround a cyclone about 4,000 kilometers in diameter, just offset from the giant planet's geographic north pole. Similar data show a cyclone at the Jovian south pole with five circumpolar cyclones. The south pole cyclones are slightly larger than their northern cousins. Oddly, data from the once Saturn-orbiting Cassini mission has shown that Saturn's north and south poles each have only a single cyclonic storm system.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀
<p>The Mercury love continues! Tonight, Mercury will be at its highest altitude in evening sky. Mercury will start to become visible low in the west around 6:30pm, very close to its neighbor, Venus.</p>

<p>Mercury’s highest visible altitude will be about 13 degrees above the horizon, around 20 minutes after sunset at 6:20pm. At this point, Mercury will be at it’s highest, but it will be dimmer than if you go out slightly later. But don’t wait too long. Mercury will be setting around 7:20pm, so there will be a relatively short viewing window!</p>
