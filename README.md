## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
You'd think the Pacman Nebula would be eating stars, but actually it is forming them. Within the nebula, a cluster's young, massive stars are powering the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense Bok globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters in Spain in mid 2024. It combines emissions from the nebula's hydrogen and oxygen atoms to synthesize red, green, and blue colors. The scene spans well over 80 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 281.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>On this date in 1655, Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens discovered Saturn’s moon Titan. It wasn’t until 1847 that this moon received its official name of Titan. It was named by John Herschel, who was the son of William Herschel – discoverer of Saturn’s moons Mimas and Enceladus.</p>

<p>The image on the right is a mosaic of images of Titan’s surface taken by the <i>Huygen</i><i>s</i> probe, named after Titan’s discoverer, as it descended to the surface. The <i>Huygens</i> probe was the first lander to touch down on a surface in the outer solar system beyond Mars. The probe drifted for two hours taking photographs and measurements of the lower atmospheric composition of Titan to be transmitted back to Earth.</p>
