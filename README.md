## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What’s causing those lines? Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water — but why? If the water’s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots. But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line. The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise. Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea. The other bright object on the right with a water-reflected line is a beacon on a rock to warn passing boats.   Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Tonight, the Eta Aquariids meteor shower peaks. The meteor shower happens annually from April 19th to May 28th with peaks typically around the 5th. The shower will be at its best once the radiant constellation, Aquarius, is above the horizon. This happens around 3:00am and will last up until the Sun rises.</p>

<p>With Aquarius rising so close to sunrise, this will inhibit the number of meteors you may see. But you may catch a few if you’re an early riser!</p>
