## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse? The blue band is real but usually quite hard to see. The featured HDR image of last week's lunar eclipse, however -- taken from Norman, Oklahoma (USA) -- has been digitally processed to exaggerate  the colors.  The gray color on the upper right of the top lunar image is the Moon's natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight. The lower parts of the Moon on all three images are not directly lit by the Sun since it is being eclipsed -- it is in the Earth's shadow. It is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through Earth's atmosphere. This part of the Moon is red -- and called a blood Moon -- for the same reason that Earth's sunsets are red: because air scatters away more blue light than red. The unusual purple-blue band visible on the upper right of the top and middle images is different -- its color is augmented by sunlight that has passed high through Earth's atmosphere, where red light is better absorbed by ozone than blue.

<p>Tonight, the Beehive Cluster (M44), a popular spring deep sky object, is placed well in the sky around 9:00pm.</p>

<p>The Beehive Cluster is found in the middle of the zodiac constellation Cancer the Crab. The Crab is found in between the zodiac patterns of Gemini the Twins and Leo the Lion. M44 is an example of an open star cluster which is a cluster that is made up of a tight knit group of stars that are all relatively young and around the same age. The Beehive Cluster is also one of the nearest open clusters to the Earth, as it sits about 610 lightyears away.</p>
