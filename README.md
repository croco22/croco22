## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What’s happening in the center of spiral galaxy NGC 2566? First, the eight rays that appear to be coming out of the center in the featured infrared image are not real — they are diffraction spikes caused by the mechanical structure of the Webb space telescope itself. The center of NGC 2566 is bright but not considered unusual, which means that it likely contains a supermassive black hole, although currently not very active. At only 76 million light years away, the light we see from NGC 2566 today left when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The picturesque galaxy is close enough so that Earthly telescopes, including Webb and Hubble, can resolve the turbulent clouds of gas and dust where stars can form and so allows study of stellar evolution. NGC 2566, similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy, is notable for its bright central bar and its prominent outer spiral arms.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>On this date in 1961, President Kennedy before a special joint session of congress announced the goal of putting an American on the Moon by the end of the decade. This was accomplished on July 20, 1969. Over 50 years later, NASA’s Artemis program is working on returning humans to the lunar surface by 2026.</p>
<p>The next planned Artemis mission is Artemis II, which will send the first crewed lunar orbit flight since the end of the Apollo missions. Currently Artemis II is scheduled for launch in early 2026.</p>
