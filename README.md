## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Like Earth's moon, Saturn's largest moon Titan is locked in synchronous rotation with its planet. This mosaic of images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft in May of 2012 shows its anti-Saturn side, the side always facing away from the ringed gas giant. The only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, Titan is the only solar system world besides Earth known to have standing bodies of liquid on its surface and an earthlike cycle of liquid rain and evaporation. Its high altitude layer of atmospheric haze is evident in the Cassini view of the 5,000 kilometer diameter moon over Saturn's rings and cloud tops. Near center is the dark dune-filled region known as Shangri-La. The Cassini-delivered Huygens probe rests below and left of center, after the most distant landing for a spacecraft from Earth.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the asteroid Vesta will be at opposition in the constellation Virgo. The asteroid will rise in the east as the sun sets and reach a magnitude of 5.4.</p>

<p>This will be one of the brightest magnitudes Vesta can get to. There are a couple factors going into its brightness tonight. The asteroid is at opposition, meaning it is directly opposite from the Sun in the sky. But along with opposition, Vesta is passing its perigee point, or its closest approach to Earth. These two factors happening at the same time give Vesta its extra bright magnitude. In optimum conditions, a magnitude of 5.4 is bordering the limit to what the naked eye can see (which is around a magnitude of 6.5). Which also means that you won’t need a telescope to see Vesta at opposition! But a pair of binoculars could help with your search!</p>
