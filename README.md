## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
In the upper left corner, surrounded by blue arms and dotted with red nebulas, is spiral galaxy M81.  In the lower right corner, marked by a light central line and surrounded by red glowing gas, is irregular galaxy M82.  This stunning vista shows these two mammoth galaxies locked in gravitational combat, as they have been for the past billion years.   The gravity from each galaxy dramatically affects the other during each hundred-million-year pass.  Last go-round, M82's gravity likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81's spiral arms.  But M81 left M82 with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.  This big battle is seen from Earth through the faint glow of an Integrated Flux Nebula, a little studied complex of diffuse gas and dust clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy. In a few billion years, only one galaxy will remain.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The summer constellation Hercules is seen rising in the east around 10:00pm tonight. As this pattern gets higher in the sky, It’s an indication that summer is on its way.</p>

<p>To find Hercules, you can use the brightest star of the summer sky, Vega, to draw a line from it to what is known as “the keystone”. The keystone is the trapezoid representing the body of Hercules.</p>
