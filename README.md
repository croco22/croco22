## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Stars are forming in Lynds Dark Nebula (LDN) 1251. About 1,000 light-years away and drifting above the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, LDN 1251 is also less appetizingly known as "The Rotten Fish Nebula." The dusty molecular cloud is part of a complex of dark nebulae mapped toward the Cepheus flare region. Across the spectrum, astronomical explorations of the obscuring interstellar clouds reveal energetic shocks and outflows associated with newborn stars, including the telltale reddish glow from scattered Herbig-Haro objects hiding in the image. Distant background galaxies also lurk in the scene, almost buried behind the dusty expanse. This alluring telescopic frame spans almost three full moons on the sky. That corresponds to over 25 light-years at the estimated distance of LDN 1251.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Full moon occurs tonight. Lunar maria, or the dark spots, are good targets to explore on nights of the full moon. These are the large dark patches you can see with just your eyes.</p>

<p>These dark spots are basaltic plains that were formed by lava flowing into ancient impact basins. The name “maria” is latin for “seas” due to ancient astronomers mistaking these dark spots for actual oceans on the surface of the Moon. Different sized maria are named based on other latinized water features such as <i>oceanus</i> (ocean), <i>lacus</i> (‘lake’), <i>palus</i> (‘marsh’), and <i>sinus</i> (‘bay’).</p>
