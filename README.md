## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Can the Sun appear to rise twice at the same time? This was just the case a few days ago from Les Escoumins, Quebec, Canada as our Solar System's bright central orb rose just as it was being partially eclipsed by the Moon. The featured video shows this unusual double-sunrise in real time and being reflected by the St. Lawrence River. Soon after the initial two spots of light appear over distant clouds, what appears to be bright horns become visible -- which are really just parts of the Sun not being eclipsed. Soon, the entire eclipsed Sun is visible above the horizon.  In all, this broken sunrise took less than two minutes during a partial eclipse that lasted many times longer.   Although the Moon circles the Earth once a month (moon-th), it does not always eclipse the Sun because its tilted orbit usually takes it above or below.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the dwarf planet Makemake will be at opposition in the constellation of Coma Berenices, 20 years to the day after its discovery. This minor planet sits 4.82 billion miles from the Earth and will have a magnitude of 17.0. This means you will need a larger telescope to view this Kuiper Belt object.</p>

<p>The name Makemake comes from the indigenous Rapa Nui people of Easter Island. Makemake is the name of the creator of humanity and god of fertility in the mythology of the Rapa Nui. This continued the millennium old tradition of naming planets after deities of mythology.</p>
<p>A deity from Rapa Nui mythology was chosen due to the dwarf planet being discovered shortly after Easter on March 31st, 2005. Its codename among astronomers before being announced to the public was “Easterbunny”.</p>
