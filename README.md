## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
If you have looked at the sky and seen a group of stars about the size of the full Moon, that's the Pleiades (M45). Perhaps the most famous star cluster in the sky, its brightest stars can be seen even from the light-polluted cities. But your unaided eye can also see its nebulosity -- the gas and dust surrounding it -- under dark skies. However, telescopes can catch even more. The bright blue stars of the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, light up their surrounding dust, causing it to appear a diffuse blue that can only be seen under long exposures. But that's not all. The cosmic dust appears to stretch upward like ethereal arms. And the entire structure is surrounded by a reddish glow from the most abundant element in the universe: hydrogen. The featured image is composed of nearly 25 hours of exposure and was captured last year from Starfront Observatory, in Texas, USA  Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>On this date in 1992, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 made its closest approach to Jupiter – 74,364 mi (119,677 km) from the surface. The comet wasn’t discovered until 1993, but calculations show that as it passed by in July of 1992, Jupiter’s tidal forces had pulled the comet apart. The fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9 – 21 pieces in total – collided with Jupiter between July 16 and 22, 1994 creating large dark spots in the planet’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>The two images above show the impact sites on the southern hemisphere of Jupiter. They are the dark brown spots that seem to form a line under the great red spot. The image on the left is a visible light Hubble image of the impact spots. The image on the right is a view of the impact spots in ultraviolet light, also taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The dark circle appearing in the northern hemisphere of the ultraviolet image is a transit shadow of Io, one of the four Galilean Moons.</p>
