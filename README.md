## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Jupiter is stranger than we knew. NASA's Juno spacecraft has now completed over 70 swoops past Jupiter as it moves around its highly elliptical orbit. Pictured from 2017, Jupiter is seen from below where, surprisingly, the horizontal bands that cover most of the planet disappear into swirls and complex patterns.  A line of white oval clouds is visible nearer to the equator.  Impressive results from Juno show that Jupiter's weather phenomena can extend deep below its cloud tops, that Jupiter's center has a core that is unexpectedly large and soft, and that Jupiter's magnetic field varies greatly with location.  Although Juno is scheduled to keep orbiting Jupiter further into 2025, at some time the robotic spacecraft will be maneuvered to plunge into the giant planet.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, point your telescope toward the constellation Coma Berenices to get a good look at M64, or the Black Eye Galaxy. Another fan-favorite springtime galaxy at a magnitude of 8.5, it’s visible through a set of binoculars. But you’ll need a telescope to see the interesting features that give this galaxy its nickname!</p>

<p>This galaxy sits 17 million lightyears away and has an apparent magnitude of approximately +9.4. The Black Eye Galaxy is also a Type II Seyfert Galaxy. These galaxies are characterized by their significant energy output and surface brightness of their galactic nucleus. In visible light, they look like normal spiral galaxies, but when observing in lower energy wavelengths, the energy intensity of their cores is comparable to the luminous intensity of the entire Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
