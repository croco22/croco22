## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Why are there so many moonquakes?   Analyses of seismometers left on the moon during the Apollo moon landings reveal a surprising number of moonquakes occurring within 100 kilometers of the surface.   In fact, 62 moonquakes were detected in data recorded between 1972 and 1977.   Many of these moonquakes are not only strong enough to move furniture in a lunar apartment, but the stiff rock of the moon continues to vibrate for many minutes, significantly longer than the softer rock earthquakes on Earth.   The cause of the moonquakes remains unknown, but a leading hypothesis include tidal gravity from -- and relative heating by -- our Earth. Regardless of the source, future moon dwellings need to be built to withstand the frequent shakings.   Pictured here, Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin stands beside a recently deployed lunar seismometer, looking back toward the lunar landing module.    Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, there will be a close approach/conjunction of the Moon and Mars. The pair will be seen together in the zodiacal constellation of Gemini the Twins. They will be about one degree apart from each other.</p>

<p>If you have a set of binoculars, or even a small telescope, you should be able to get both the Moon and Mars into the same field of view of your instrument! These close approaches of objects are good ways to get more comfortable with telescopes and binoculars.</p>
