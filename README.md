## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What does our Milky Way Galaxy look like from the side? Because we are on the inside, humanity can’t get an actual picture. Recently, however, just such a map has been made using location data for over a billion stars from ESA’s Gaia mission. The resulting featured illustration shows that just like many other spiral galaxies, our Milky Way has a very thin central disk. Our Sun and all the stars we see at night are in this disk. Although hypothesized before, perhaps more surprising is that the disk appears curved at the outer edges. The colors of our Galaxy's warped central band derive mostly from dark dust, bright blue stars, and red emission nebulas. Although data analysis is ongoing, Gaia was deactivated in March after a successful mission.   Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>The Space Shuttle mission STS-125 launched today in 2009. This was the last servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.slsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/may-11.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>During the 14-day mission, the crew of STS-125 added two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope. These were the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and the Wide Field Camera 3. While the Hubble was docked in the Space Shuttle <i>Atlantis</i>’ payload bay, the crew also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six gyroscopes, a thermal blanket for insulating panels, and two battery unit modules. The repairs allowed for the telescope to continue function until at least 2014. The Hubble has surpassed that date as it is still in operation today.</p>
<p>The image on the left is of the Hubble Space Telescope being lifted out of the payload bay of <i>Atlantis</i> by the robotic arm and being released back into orbit at the end of the mission. The image on the right is of NASA astronaut John Grunsfeld performing the first of five spacewalks to service the telescope. In this image we get a really good idea of how large the Hubble Space Telescope is compared to Grunsfeld.</p>
