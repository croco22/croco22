## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Typically, the International Space Station is visible only at night.  Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS's silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Sant Feliu de Buixalleu, Spain with perfect timing.  This image series was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the active Sun which included several Sun's prominences around the edge.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Did you know, there are moons in our solar system that are larger than a planet? The moons Ganymede and Titan are both larger than our smallest rocky planet Mercury. But it’s because they orbit a planet and not the Sun, they cannot be considered planets themselves.</p>

<p>This image shows the largest 26 moons and rocky planets in the solar system. Ganymede has a diameter of 3,270 miles, Titan’s diameter in 3,199 miles, while Mercury’s diameter is 3,032 miles.</p>
