## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Can you find the Rosette Nebula? The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that's not it.  The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosette's field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula's center.  The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon. This flowery field can be found toward the constellation of the Unicorn  (Monoceros).   Explore Your Universe: Random APOD Generator

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the Butterfly Star Cluster (M6) is well placed for observing. It will reach its highest point in the sky around midnight and will culminate approximately four minutes earlier each night over the coming weeks. Located in Scorpius the Scorpion, M6 is a bright open star cluster located in the direction of the galactic center approximately 1,600 light years from Earth.</p>

<p>The Butterfly Cluster was first recorded in 1654 by Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna. Charles Messier observed it in 1764 and added it to his Messier Catalog. At a magnitude of 4.2, this cluster can be viewed naked eye in dark conditions.</p>
