## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
A 26 hour old Moon poses behind the craggy outline of the Italian Dolomites in this twilight mountain and skyscape. The one second long exposure was captured near moonset on March 30. And while only a a sliver of its sunlit surface is visible, most of the Moon's disk can be seen by earthshine as light reflected from a bright planet Earth illuminates the lunar nearside. Also known as the Moon's ashen glow, a description of earthshine in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. Of course earthshine is just the most familiar example of planetshine, the faint illumination of the dark portion of a moon by light reflected from its planet.

<p>The Sombrero Galaxy, also known as M104 or NGC 4594, is named after the dark dust lane of the galaxy appearing to look like the brim of a sombrero hat. This galaxy is also classified as a peculiar galaxy. This means it is a galaxy of unusual size, shape or composition. Only between 5% – 10% of known galaxies in the universe are categorized as peculiar. This makes the Sombrero Galaxy an extra special spring object!</p>
