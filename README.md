## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, but definitely not one of the least. About 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost twice the size of our own Milky Way. M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsontown. Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region of M101 in one of the highest definition spiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble. The sharp image shows stunning features of the galaxy's face-on disk of stars and dust along with background galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself. Also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101 lies within the boundaries of the northern constellation Ursa Major, about 25 million light-years away.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the open star cluster called The Coma Star Cluster will be found high in the southern sky around 10:00pm. The brighter stars of the cluster make a distinct V-shape.</p>

<p>In ancient times, this cluster represented the tail of Leo the Lion. But around 240 BCE, the Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy III renamed it for his wife and Egyptian Queen Berenice II. As the story goes, Queen Berenice sacrificed her hair to Aphrodite in hopes that her husband would return safe from war. The next day Berenice’s lock was missing from the temple, presumed to be accepted by the gods. Greek astronomer and mathematician, Conon of Samos, identified this star cluster as the queen’s lock of hair, placed into the sky to honor her sacrifice.</p>
