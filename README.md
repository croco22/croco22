## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
The first to orbit inner planet Mercury, the MESSENGER spacecraft came to rest on this region of Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015. Constructed from MESSENGER image and laser altimeter data, the projected scene looks north over the northeastern rim of the broad, lava filled Shakespeare basin. The large, 48 kilometer (30 mile) wide crater Janacek is near the upper left edge. Terrain height is color coded with red regions about 3 kilometers above blue ones. MESSENGER'S final orbit was predicted to end near the center, with the spacecraft impacting the surface at nearly 4 kilometers per second (over 8,700 miles per hour) and creating a new crater about 16 meters (52 feet) in diameter. The impact on the far side of Mercury was not observed by telescopes, but confirmed when no signal was detected from the spacecraft given time to emerge from behind the planet. Launched in 2004, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemisty and Ranging spacecraft completed over 4,000 orbits after reaching the Solar System's innermost planet in 2011.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, a very thin waxing crescent moon and Jupiter will appear low in the western sky together. The pair can be spotted close by after sunset around 8:45pm.</p>

<p>Soon, Jupiter will no longer be visible in the evening sky. It is currently located in the winter zodiacal constellation of Taurus the Bull. By early June, the planet will begin to be blocked by buildings or trees before eventually moving behind the Sun.</p>
