## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What created this unusual hole in Mars? Actually, there are numerous holes pictured in this Swiss cheese-like landscape, with all-but-one of them showing a dusty, dark, Martian terrain beneath evaporating, light, carbon dioxide ice.  The most unusual hole is on the upper right, spans about 100 meters, and seems to punch through to a lower level. Why this hole exists and why it is surrounded by a circular crater remains a topic of speculation, although a leading hypothesis is that it was created by a meteor impact.  Holes such as this are of particular interest because they might be portals to lower levels that extend into expansive underground caves. If so, these naturally occurring tunnels are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life. These pits are therefore also prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Forecast for high heat at Venus! The second planet from the Sun is often referred to as “Earth’s Twin” due to their size, but it couldn’t be more the opposite. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system due to its thick and crushing atmosphere of sulfuric acids clouds. The average temperature on Venus is 900 degrees Fahrenheit!</p>

<p>This radar image of Venus’ northern hemisphere was taken by the Magellan spacecraft in 1996 with radar technology. Due to the incredibly thick atmosphere that causes the extreme temperatures on Venus, the surface is not visible without the help of imaging technology.</p>
