## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What if you could fly over Pluto -- what might you see? The New Horizons spacecraft did just this in 2015 July as it shot past the distant world at a speed of about 80,000 kilometers per hour. Images from this spectacular passage have been color enhanced, vertically scaled, and digitally combined into the featured two-minute time-lapse video. As your journey begins, light dawns on mountains thought to be composed of water ice but colored by frozen nitrogen.  Soon, to your right, you see a flat sea of mostly solid nitrogen that has segmented into strange polygons that are thought to have bubbled up from a comparatively warm interior.  Craters and ice mountains are common sights below. The video dims and ends over terrain dubbed bladed because it shows 500-meter high ridges separated by kilometer-sized gaps.  The robotic New Horizons spacecraft has too much momentum to ever return to Pluto and is now headed out of our Solar System.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Have you ever wondered why the rocky planets are found closer to the Sun while the gaseous planets are found farther away? There are lots of potential explanations! One explanation is that during the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago, heavier materials like rock and metal were more heat resistant than the volatile compounds that make up the gas giants. Leading to the inner planets being rocky!</p>

<p>The four inner and rocky planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The intense heat and solar wind can also be an explanation as to why the rocky planets are smaller than their gaseous neighbors. The gas giants exist in an area of the solar system where gas can accumulate in large quantities due to be farther away from the Sun, making them very large! The rocky planets are not able to do this.</p>
