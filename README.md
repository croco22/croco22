## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Savudrija lighthouse shines along the coast near the northern end of the Istrian peninsula in this well-composed night skyscape. A navigational aid for sailors on the Adriatic Sea, the historic lighthouse was constructed in the early 19th century. But an even older aid to navigation shines in the sky above, Polaris, alpha star of the constellation Ursa Minor and also known as the North Star. In this scene Polaris forms the shortest bright arc near the North Celestial Pole, the extension of Earth's axis of rotation into space. Of course, the North Celestial Pole lies exactly at the center of all the concentric startrails. The composite image is a digital stack of 400 exposures, each 30 seconds long, taken with camera and tripod fixed to a rotating planet.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Did you know, black holes have theoretical opposites known as white holes? White holes are essentially the opposite of black holes, spewing out immense amounts of light rather than trapping all light. Presently there have been no confirmations of white holes existing.</p>

<p>The image above depicts how a black hole and white hole would appear, with the two being connected through a singularity. White holes are often depicted as the exit point of theoretical wormholes. Although, just like the white holes, wormholes have also never been observed in the universe and remain theoretical.</p>
