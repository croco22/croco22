## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What's that unusual spot on the Moon? It's the International Space Station. Using precise timing, the Earth-orbiting space platform was photographed in front of a partially lit gibbous Moon in 2019. The featured image was taken from Palo Alto, California, USA with an exposure time of only 1/667 of a second. In contrast, the duration of the transit of the ISS across the entire Moon was about half a second.  A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.  The bright crater Tycho is visible on the lower left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.  Downloadable  apps can tell you when the International Space Station will be visible from your area.   APOD Turns 30!: Free Public Lecture in Cork, Ireland on June 24

<p>The image on the left is of Ride in her official NASA portrait. The image on the right is Ride floating free in microgravity on the flight deck of the Space Shuttle Challenger during STS-7. As well as being the youngest astronaut to have flown a mission, being only 32 during her first spaceflight, Ride also helped in developing the space shuttles robotic arm. She operated the arm during STS-7 to deploy satellites.</p>
<p>Sally Ride passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2012. Her obituary revealed publicly for the first time, her life partner of 27 years was Tam O’Shaughnessy, former Women’s Tennis Association player. This made her the first astronaut known to have been a part of the LGBTQ+ community. Even after her death, Ride continues to be an inspiration for women and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
