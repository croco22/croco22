## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
About 1,300 images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft's wide angle camera were used to compose this spectacular view of a familiar face - the lunar nearside. But why is there a lunar nearside? The Moon rotates on its axis and orbits the Earth at the same rate, about once every 28 days. Tidally locked in this configuration, the synchronous rotation always keeps one side, the nearside, facing Earth. As a result, featured in remarkable detail in the full resolution mosaic, the smooth, dark, lunar maria (actually lava-flooded impact basins), and rugged highlands, are well-known to earthbound skygazers. To find your favorite mare or large crater, just follow this link or slide your cursor over the picture. The LRO images used to construct the mosaic were recorded over a two week period in December 2010.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the galactic center of the Milky Way Galaxy will be due south around 10:00pm. Summer is deemed the best time to observe the Milky Way due to the Earth being positioned facing towards the center of the galaxy during this time of the year.</p>

<p>To see the Milky Way Galaxy, you will have to travel to a dark sky site. Due to the light pollution in heavily populated areas, like St. Louis, the galaxy is washed away from artificial light bouncing back towards the ground from the atmosphere above us. To find a dark sky site, check out online bortle maps, such as <a href="https://lightpollutionmap.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://lightpollutionmap.app/</a></p>
