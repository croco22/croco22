## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
This was a very unusual type of solar eclipse.  Typically, it is the Earth's Moon that eclipses the Sun.  In 2012, though, the planet Venus took a turn.  Like a solar eclipse by the Moon, the phase of Venus became a continually thinner crescent as Venus became increasingly better aligned with the Sun.  Eventually the alignment became perfect and the phase of Venus dropped to zero.  The dark spot of Venus crossed our parent star.  The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian annular eclipse with an extraordinarily large ring of fire.  Pictured here during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a coronal hole. Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a slight crescent phase appeared again.  The next Venusian transit across the Sun will occur in 2117.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (2 days offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>It is possible to see satellites in the night sky. Some, like the International Space Station, can appear even brighter than some stars. In fact, tonight there will be a pass of the international space station from the WSW to the NE, taking almost seven minutes to move across the sky.</p>

<p>The space station will reach an apparent magnitude of -3.0 during this pass, which will put it in between the brightness values of Venus and Jupiter. Venus will be the brightest point of light at -4.1, followed by the ISS, then Jupiter next at a magnitude of -2.1. The larger the negative number, the brighter the object.</p>
