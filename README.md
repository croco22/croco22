## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What's different about this Moon? It's the terminators. In the featured image, you can't directly see any terminator -- the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night. That's because the featured image is a digital composite of many near-terminator lunar strips over a full Moon.  Terminator regions show the longest and most prominent shadows -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear three-dimensional. The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April.  Many of the Moon's craters stand out because of the shadows they all cast to the right. The image shows in graphic detail that the darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the Moon -- they are also flatter.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 (1 day offset since no new article has been published yet)
<p>Tonight, the dwarf planet Haumea will be at opposition in the constellation of Boötes. This minor planet that sits four billion miles from the Earth will be at a magnitude of 17.25. This means you will need a larger telescope to view the dwarf planet.</p>

<p>Haumea is interesting when it comes to solar system objects, as it is one of the fastest rotating large objects. The dwarf planet is donut shaped due to its repaid rotation on its axis. In fact, on day on Haumea lasts approximately four earth hours! This means that one Haumean year takes approximately 624,150 Haumean days!</p>
