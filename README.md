## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
What are all those streaks in the sky? A galaxy, many satellite trails, and a few meteors.  First, far in the distance, the majestic band of our Milky Way Galaxy runs down the left. Mirroring it on the right are several parallel trails of Earth-orbiting Starlink satellites. Many fainter satellite trails also crisscross the image. The two short and bright streaks are meteors — likely members of the annual Eta Aquariids meteor shower.  The planet Venus shines on the lower right.  Venus and the satellites shine by reflected sunlight. The featured picture is a composite of exposures all taken in a few hours on May 4 over the Limay River in Argentina.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>The Greek hero of Hercules, a well-known summer constellation, is famous for the legend of his 12 labors. Did you know that there are a few constellations that are sometimes seen as references to his labors? For example, Hydra, a constellation found in the spring, is often associated with Hercules’ second labor: slaying the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra.</p>

<p>Hydra is still currently visible in the evening sky, although it is rather low in the west as we move farther into summer. As the snake is the largest of all official IAU constellations, it almost stretched completely from due south to due west along the horizon.</p>
