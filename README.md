## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
As the Sun set, a bright Full Moon rose on July 10. Its golden light illuminates clouds drifting through southern hemisphere skies in this well-composed telephoto image from Conceição do Coité, Bahia, Brazil. The brightest lunar phase is captured here with both a short and long exposure. The two exposures were combined to reveal details of the lunar surface in bright moonlight and a subtle iridescence along the dramatically backlit cloudscape. Of course, July's Full Moon is a winter moon in the southern hemisphere.  But in the north it's known to some as the Thunder Moon, likely a nod to the sounds of this northern summer month's typically stormy weather.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Saturn enters retrograde motion tonight. This means the planet will stop its usual eastward motion through the sky and begin moving westward instead. This motion is due to the Earth catching up to Saturn in its orbit, causing the change in perspective.</p>

<p>Typically, all the outer planets of the solar system will undergo retrograde motion a few months before they reach opposition. Opposition is when the planet is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun and usually begins rising around sunset. Saturn reaches opposition on September 21st, 2025.</p>
<p>The image above is one of the more famous images of Saturn taken by the Cassini spacecraft as it was approaching the ringed planet for its science mission in 2004.</p>
