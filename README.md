## The Story Behind the Image 🧑‍🚀🔭
Beautiful emission nebula NGC 6164 was created by a rare, hot, luminous O-type star, some 40 times as massive as the Sun. Seen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere 3 to 4 million years old. In another three to four million years the massive star will end its life in a supernova explosion. Spanning around 4 light-years, the nebula itself has a bipolar symmetry. That makes it similar in appearance to more common and familiar planetary nebulae - the gaseous shrouds surrounding dying sun-like stars. Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have an extensive, faint halo, revealed in this deep image of the region. Expanding into the surrounding interstellar medium, the material in the halo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star. This gorgeous telescopic view is a composite of extensive narrow-band image data, highlighting glowing atomic hydrogen gas in red and oxygen in greenish hues, with broad-band data for the surrounding starfield. Also known as the Dragon's Egg nebula, NGC 6164 is 4,200 light-years away in the right-angled southern constellation of Norma.

## Astronomy Fact of the Day 👩‍🚀🚀 
<p>Forecast calls for a rainy day on Titan! Titan is a special moon due to it being the only other world in the solar system that has bodies of liquid on its surface. Although on Titan its not liquid water, but liquid methane that forms huge rivers and lakes on the surface. Due to this, Titan is the only other place with a liquid cycle like the water cycle here on Earth.</p>

<p>These three images show us different views of Titan’s atmosphere all taken by the Cassini spacecraft. The image on the left is a true color image of Titan, showcasing the thick atmosphere that creates the methane this moon experiences. The atmosphere is so thick that in true color, we cannot see the surface of Titan. The center and right images are both images taken with infrared-sensitive instruments that can peer through the atmosphere. They show us the surface where we can see how the methane rain, and other environmental factors, have potentially altered the landscape. The center image is a monochrome view, and the right image is a false color view.</p>
